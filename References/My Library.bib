	abstract = {The development of new biological and chemical instruments for research and diagnostic applications is often slowed by the cost, specialization, and custom nature of these instruments. New instruments are built from components that are drawn from a host of different disciplines and not designed to integrate together, and once built, an instrument typically performs a limited number of tasks and cannot be easily adapted for new applications. Consequently, the process of inventing new instruments is very inefficient, especially for researchers or clinicians in resource-limited settings. To improve this situation, we propose that a family of  standardized multidisciplinary components  is needed, a set of “building blocks” that perform a wide array of different tasks and are designed to integrate together. Using these components, scientists, engineers, and clinicians would be able to build custom instruments for their own unique needs quickly and easily. In this work we present the foundation of this set of components, a system we call Multifluidic Evolutionary Components ({MECs}). “Multifluidic” conveys the wide range of fluid volumes {MECs} operate upon (from nanoliters to milliliters and beyond); “multi” also reflects the multiple disciplines supported by the system (not only fluidics but also electronics, optics, and mechanics). “Evolutionary” refers to the design principles that enable the library of {MEC} parts to easily grow and adapt to new applications. Each {MEC} “building block” performs a fundamental function that is commonly found in biological or chemical instruments, functions like valving, pumping, mixing, controlling, and sensing. Each {MEC} also has a unique symbol linked to a physical definition, which enables instruments to be designed rapidly and efficiently using schematics. As a proof-of-concept, we use {MECs} to build a variety of instruments, including a fluidic routing and mixing system capable of manipulating fluid volumes over five orders of magnitude, an acid-base titration instrument suitable for use in schools, and a bioreactor suitable for maintaining and analyzing cell cultures in research and diagnostic applications. These are the first of many instruments that can be built by researchers, clinicians, and students using the {MEC} system.},

	abstract = {Optical clearing methods facilitate deep biological imaging by mitigating light scattering in situ. Multi-scale high-resolution imaging requires preservation of tissue integrity for accurate signal reconstruction. However, existing clearing reagents contain chemical components that could compromise tissue structure, preventing reproducible anatomical and fluorescence signal stability. We developed {ScaleS}, a sorbitol-based optical clearing method that provides stable tissue preservation for immunochemical labeling and three-dimensional (3D) signal rendering. {ScaleS} permitted optical reconstructions of aged and diseased brain in Alzheimer's disease models, including mapping of 3D networks of amyloid plaques, neurons and microglia, and multi-scale tracking of single plaques by successive fluorescence and electron microscopy. Human clinical samples from Alzheimer's disease patients analyzed via reversible optical re-sectioning illuminated plaque pathogenesis in the z axis. Comparative benchmarking of contemporary clearing agents showed superior signal and structure preservation by {ScaleS}. These findings suggest that {ScaleS} is a simple and reproducible method for accurate visualization of biological tissue.

	doi = {10.4161/bioa.1.1.14799},
	abstract = {It was light microscopy that first revealed the hidden world of bacteria and the unit of life the “cell.” From these first observations, made in the late 1600s, it has been clear that seeing is an important tool in biology. The merging of the fields of fluorescence and microscopy created the possibility to see subcellular structures and proteins. In the 1990s the use of the confocal microscopes, where cells/tissue could be optically sectioned, further improved the resolution of object visualization. From this microworld view we now move forward to the exciting prospects of the nanoworld view of biology. In this review I propose a nanoimaging approach, nanoscopy, which could be used to reveal cell architecture at the level of proteins and protein complexes. Nanoscopy includes, the F-techniques, superresolution microscopy, correlative light and electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. To illustrate the biology that could be investigated by nanoscopy we focus on structures formed at the actin-membrane interface. In particular, focal adhesions and stress fibres have been analyzed using nanoscopy. Many of the proteins present in focal adhesions and stress fibres are shared with structures such as filopodia, lamellipodia, endocytic vesicles, actin pedestals and invadopodia. It is likely that nanoscopy of cells will reveal mechanistic details of biology at the level of individual proteins and protein complexes and importantly in a physiological context.},

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence implicates the significance of the physical properties of the niche in influencing the behavior, growth and differentiation of stem cells. Among the physical properties, extracellular stiffness has been shown to have direct effects on fate determination in several cell types in vitro . However, little evidence exists concerning whether shifts in stiffness occur in vivo during tissue development. To address this question, we present a systematic strategy to evaluate the shift in stiffness in a developing tissue using the mouse embryonic cerebral cortex as an experimental model. We combined atomic force microscopy measurements of tissue and cellular stiffness with immunostaining of specific markers of neural differentiation to correlate the value of stiffness with the characteristic features of tissues and cells in the developing brain. We found that the stiffness of the ventricular and subventricular zones increases gradually during development. Furthermore, a peak in tissue stiffness appeared in the intermediate zone at E16.5. The stiffness of the cortical plate showed an initial increase but decreased at E18.5, although the cellular stiffness of neurons monotonically increased in association with the maturation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. These results indicate that tissue stiffness cannot be solely determined by the stiffness of the cells that constitute the tissue. Taken together, our method profiles the stiffness of living tissue and cells with defined characteristics and can therefore be utilized to further understand the role of stiffness as a physical factor that determines cell fate during the formation of the cerebral cortex and other tissues.},

	abstract = {Visualization of infection and the associated host response has been challenging in adult vertebrates. Owing to their transparency, zebrafish larvae have been used to directly observe infection in vivo ; however, such larvae have not yet developed a functional adaptive immune system. Cells involved in adaptive immunity mature later and have therefore been difficult to access optically in intact animals. Thus, the study of many aspects of vertebrate infection requires dissection of adult organs or ex vivo isolation of immune cells. Recently, {CLARITY} and {PACT} (passive clarity technique) methodologies have enabled clearing and direct visualization of dissected organs. Here, we show that these techniques can be applied to image host-pathogen interactions directly in whole animals. {CLARITY} and {PACT}-based clearing of whole adult zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis -infected mouse lungs enables imaging of mycobacterial granulomas deep within tissue to a depth of more than 1 mm. Using established transgenic lines, we were able to image normal and pathogenic structures and their surrounding host context at high resolution. We identified the three-dimensional organization of granuloma-associated angiogenesis, an important feature of mycobacterial infection, and characterized the induction of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}) within the granuloma using an established fluorescent reporter line. We observed heterogeneity in {TNF} induction within granuloma macrophages, consistent with an evolving view of the tuberculous granuloma as a non-uniform, heterogeneous structure. Broad application of this technique will enable new understanding of host-pathogen interactions in situ .},

Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.},

The system combines two-dimensional illumination with orthogonal camera-based detection to achieve high-resolution, optically sectioned imaging throughout the sample, with minimal photodamage and at speeds capable of capturing transient biological phenomena. We used {SPIM} to visualize all muscles in vivo in the transgenic Medaka line Arnie, which expresses green fluorescent protein in muscle tissue. We also demonstrate that {SPIM} can be applied to visualize the embryogenesis of the relatively opaque Drosophila melanogaster in vivo.

	abstract = {The ever-increasing speed and resolution of modern microscopes make the storage and post-processing of images challenging and prevent thorough statistical analyses in developmental biology. Here, instead of deploying massive storage and computing power, we exploit the spherical geometry of zebrafish embryos by computing a radial maximum intensity projection in real time with a 240-fold reduction in data rate. In our four-lens selective plane illumination microscope ({SPIM}) setup the development of multiple embryos is recorded in parallel and a map of all labelled cells is obtained for each embryo in {\textless}10 s. In these panoramic projections, cell segmentation and flow analysis reveal characteristic migration patterns and global tissue remodelling in the early endoderm. Merging data from many samples uncover stereotypic patterns that are fundamental to endoderm development in every embryo. We demonstrate that processing and compressing raw image data in real time is not only efficient but indispensable for image-based systems biology.},

Networks communicate through dense synaptic, electric, and modulatory connections and develop through concurrent growth and interlinking of their neurons, processes, glia, and blood vessels. These factors drive the development of techniques capable of imaging neural signaling, anatomy, and developmental processes at ever-larger scales. Here, we discuss the nature of questions benefitting from large-scale imaging techniques and introduce recent applications. We focus on emerging light-sheet microscopy approaches, which are well suited for live imaging of large systems with high spatiotemporal resolution and over long periods of time. We also discuss computational methods suitable for extracting biological information from the resulting system-level image data sets. Together with new tools for reporting and manipulating neuronal activity and gene expression, these techniques promise new insights into the large-scale function and development of neural systems.},

In vivo targeting studies of human prostate cancer growing in nude mice indicate that the {QD} probes accumulate at tumors both by the enhanced permeability and retention of tumor sites and by antibody binding to cancer-specific cell surface biomarkers. Using both subcutaneous injection of {QD}-tagged cancer cells and systemic injection of multifunctional {QD} probes, we have achieved sensitive and multicolor fluorescence imaging of cancer cells under in vivo conditions. We have also integrated a whole-body macro-illumination system with wavelength-resolved spectral imaging for efficient background removal and precise delineation of weak spectral signatures.

	abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Elastography ({MRE}) is a rapidly developing technology for quantitatively assessing the mechanical properties of tissue. The technology can be considered to be an imaging-based counterpart to palpation, commonly used by physicians to diagnose and characterize diseases. The success of palpation as a diagnostic method is based on the fact that the mechanical properties of tissues are often dramatically affected by the presence of disease processes such as cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. {MRE} obtains information about the stiffness of tissue by assessing the propagation of mechanical waves through the tissue with a special magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) technique. The technique essentially involves three steps: generating shear waves in the tissue, acquiring {MR} images depicting the propagation of the induced shear waves and processing the images of the shear waves to generate quantitative maps of tissue stiffness, called elastograms. {MRE} is already being used clinically for the assessment of patients with chronic liver diseases and is emerging as a safe, reliable and noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for staging hepatic fibrosis. {MRE} is also being investigated for application to pathologies of other organs including the brain, breast, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, lungs and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this review article is to introduce this technology to clinical anatomists and to summarize some of the current clinical applications that are being pursued.},

Axial information was instantly directed to the sample stage to keep a moving particle within the focal plane in an active feedback loop. We demonstrated 3D tracking of nanoparticles at an unprecedented depth throughout large cell nuclei over several thousand frames and a range of more than 10 µm in each spatial dimension, while simultaneously acquiring optically sectioned wide field images.

The controlled reduction of scattering and beam spreading would enable a new illumination concept for light microscopes, particularly for those designed to look deep into scattering tissue. By investigating three different classes of refractive index inhomogeneity, using two large glass spheres, a cluster of smaller spheres and a piece of human skin, respectively, we show that beam self-reconstruction is indeed possible. We demonstrate that a Bessel beam is unexpectedly robust against deflection at objects, and we define measures for self-reconstruction in this context. We present a prototype of a microscope with self-reconstructing beams ({MISERB}) and show that a holographically shaped, scanned Bessel beam not only reduces scattering artefacts, but also simultaneously increases image quality and penetration depth in dense media.},

In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months. Recently, the limits of what can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the design of molecular contrast agents.},

Monitoring of a number of parameters in time-lapse recordings of mesoderm explants revealed that Rac and Rho have both distinct and overlapping roles in regulating the motility of axial mesoderm cells. The cell behaviors revealed by activated or inhibitory versions of these {GTPases} in native tissue were clearly distinct from those previously documented in cultured fibroblasts. The dynamic properties and polarity of protrusive activity, along with lamellipodia formation, were controlled by the two {GTPases} operating in a partially redundant manner, while Rho and Rac contributed separately to cell shape and filopodia formation. We propose that Rho and Rac operate in distinct signaling pathways that are integrated to control cell motility during convergent extension.},

Multiview imaging solves the problems caused by light scattering, shadowing and anisotropy that are inherent to uniaxial optics. Sample rotation is also a fundamental aspect of optical tomography techniques3. However, image-acquisition and microscope-control software is not, by default, prepared to handle stage rotation. We present an open-source, fully customizable platform for the control of light-sheet microscopes and optical projection tomography ({OPT}) setups operating in different modes, based on Arduino and μManager4 hardware.

These “high throughput” methods are the workhorses of modern “systems biology” efforts. However, we simply cannot perform an experiment for every possible combination of different cell type, genetic mutation and other conditions. In practice this has led researchers to either exhaustively test a few conditions or targets, or to try to pick the experiments that best allow a particular problem to be explored. But which experiments should we pick? The ones we think we can predict the outcome of accurately, the ones for which we are uncertain what the results will be, or a combination of the two? Humans are not particularly well suited for this task because it requires reasoning about many possible outcomes at the same time. However, computers are much better at handling statistics for many experiments, and machine learning algorithms allow computers to “learn” how to make predictions and decisions based on the data they’ve previously processed. Previous computer simulations showed that a machine learning approach termed “active learning” could do a good job of picking a series of experiments to perform in order to efficiently learn a model that predicts the results of experiments that were not done. Now, Naik et al. have performed cell biology experiments in which experiments were chosen by an active learning algorithm and then performed using liquid handling robots and an automated microscope. The key idea behind the approach is that you learn more from an experiment you can’t predict (or that you predicted incorrectly) than from just confirming your confident predictions. The results of the robot-driven experiments showed that the active learning approach outperforms strategies a human might use, even when the potential outcomes of individual experiments are not known beforehand. The next challenge is to apply these methods to reduce the cost of achieving the goals of large projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Ongoing advances have enabled new experimental capabilities using light to inspect the nervous system across multiple spatial scales, including ultrastructural scales finer than the optical diffraction limit. Other progress permits functional imaging at faster speeds, at greater depths in brain tissue, and over larger tissue volumes than previously possible. Portable, miniaturized fluorescence microscopes now allow brain imaging in freely behaving mice. Complementary progress on animal preparations has enabled imaging in head-restrained behaving animals, as well as time-lapse microscopy studies in the brains of live subjects. Mouse genetic approaches permit mosaic and inducible fluorescence-labeling strategies, whereas intrinsic contrast mechanisms allow in vivo imaging of animals and humans without use of exogenous markers. This review surveys such advances and highlights emerging capabilities of particular interest to neuroscientists.},

We demonstrate its validity and benefits on two-dimensional (2D) and 3D localization microscopy images of tubulin and actin filaments. Our {FRC} resolution method makes it possible to compare achieved resolutions in images taken with different nanoscopy methods, to optimize and rank different emitter localization and labeling strategies, to define a stopping criterion for data acquisition, to describe image anisotropy and heterogeneity, and even to estimate the average number of localizations per emitter. Our findings challenge the current focus on obtaining the best localization precision, showing instead how the best image resolution can be achieved as fast as possible.},

Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy allows high-speed 3D live fluorescence imaging of living cellular and multicellular specimens with nearly isotropic spatial resolution, low photobleaching and low photodamage. Unlike conventional fluorescence imaging techniques that usually have a unique operation mode, Bessel plane illumination has several modes that offer different performance with different imaging metrics. To achieve optimal results from this technique, the appropriate operation mode needs to be selected and the experimental setting must be optimized for the specific application and associated sample properties. Here we explain the fundamental working principles of this technique, discuss the pros and cons of each operational mode and show through examples how to optimize experimental parameters. We also describe the procedures needed to construct, align and operate a Bessel beam plane illumination microscope by using our previously reported system as an example, and we list the necessary equipment to build such a microscope. Assuming all components are readily available, it would take a person skilled in optical instrumentation ∼1 month to assemble and operate a microscope according to this protocol.},

So far, magnetic tweezers can be divided into two categories: I), tweezers that allow the exertion of high forces but consist of only one or two poles and therefore are capable of only exerting forces in one direction; and {II}), tweezers that consist of multiple poles and allow exertion of forces in multiple directions but at very low forces. The magnetic tweezers described here combines both aspects in a single apparatus: high forces in a controllable direction. To this end, micron scale magnetic structures are fabricated using cleanroom technologies. With these tweezers, magnetic flux gradients of ∇B = 8 × 103 T m−1 can be achieved over the dimensions of a single cell. This allows exertion of forces up to 12 {pN} on paramagnetic probes with a diameter of 350 nm, enabling us to maneuver them through the cytoplasm of a living cell. It is expected that with the current tweezers, {picoNewton} forces can be exerted on beads as small as 100 nm.},

The advent of single molecule techniques over the past two decades has revolutionized the field of cell biology by providing a more quantitative picture of the complex and highly dynamic organization of living systems. Amongst these techniques, single particle tracking ({SPT}) has emerged as a powerful approach to study a variety of dynamic processes in life sciences. {SPT} provides access to single molecule behavior in the natural context of living cells, thereby allowing a complete statistical characterization of the system under study. In this review we describe the foundations of {SPT} together with novel optical implementations that nowadays allow the investigation of single molecule dynamic events with increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution using molecular densities closer to physiological expression levels. We outline some of the algorithms for the faithful reconstruction of {SPT} trajectories as well as data analysis, and highlight biological examples where the technique has provided novel insights into the role of diffusion regulating cellular function. The last part of the review concentrates on different theoretical models that describe anomalous transport behavior and ergodicity breaking observed from {SPT} studies in living cells.},

Time-lapse microscopic imaging of transgenic embryos expressing fluorescent reporters is the method of choice for tracking morphogenetic changes and establishing cell lineages and fate maps  in vivo . However, the manual steps involved in curating thousands of putative cell segmentations have been a major bottleneck in the application of these technologies especially for cell membranes. Segmentation of cell membranes while more difficult than nuclear segmentation is necessary for quantifying the relations between changes in cell morphology and morphogenesis. We present a novel and fully automated method to first reconstruct membrane signals and then segment out cells from 3D membrane images even in dense tissues. The approach has three stages: 1) detection of local membrane planes, 2) voting to fill structural gaps, and 3) region segmentation. We demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithms quantitatively on time-lapse confocal and two-photon images of zebrafish neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm by comparing its results with those derived from human inspection. We also compared with synthetic microscopic images generated by simulating the process of imaging with fluorescent reporters under varying conditions of noise. Both the over-segmentation and under-segmentation percentages of our method are around 5\%. The volume overlap of individual cells, compared to expert manual segmentation, is consistently over 84\%. By using our software ({ACME}) to study somite formation, we were able to segment touching cells with high accuracy and reliably quantify changes in morphogenetic parameters such as cell shape and size, and the arrangement of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Our software has been developed and tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms and is available publicly under an open source {BSD} license ( https://github.com/krm15/{ACME} ).},

Common techniques for fluorescence optical sectioning are confocal laser scanning microscopy and two-photon microscopy. But there is increasing interest in alternative optical sectioning techniques, particularly for applications involving high speeds, large fields of view or long-term imaging. In this Review, I examine two such techniques, based on planar illumination or structured illumination. The goal is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques.},

	abstract = {The mechanism by which cells control directional persistence during migration is a major question. However, the common index measuring directional persistence, namely the ratio of displacement to trajectory length, is biased, particularly by cell speed. An unbiased method is to calculate direction autocorrelation as a function of time. This function depends only on the angles of the vectors tangent to the trajectory. This method has not been widely used, because it is more difficult to compute. Here we discuss biases of the classical index and introduce a custom-made open-source computer program, {DiPer}, which calculates direction autocorrelation. In addition, {DiPer} also plots and calculates other essential parameters to analyze cell migration in two dimensions: it displays cell trajectories individually and collectively, and it calculates average speed and mean square displacements ({MSDs}) to assess the area explored by cells over time. This user-friendly program is executable through Microsoft Excel, and it generates plots of publication-level quality. The protocol takes ∼15 min to complete. We have recently used {DiPer} to analyze cell migration of three different mammalian cell types in 2D cultures: the mammary carcinoma cell line {MDA}-{MB}-231, the motile amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and fish-scale keratocytes. {DiPer} can potentially be used not only for random migration in 2D but also for directed migration and for migration in 3D (direction autocorrelation only). Moreover, it can be used for any types of tracked particles: cellular organelles, bacteria and whole organisms.},

Capsids bud at the inner nuclear membrane into the nuclear envelope lumen. The resulting intralumenal vesicles fuse with the outer nuclear membrane delivering the capsids to the cytoplasm. Two viral proteins are required for vesicle formation, the tail-anchored {pUL}34 and its soluble interactor {pUL}31. Whether cellular proteins are involved is unclear. Using giant unilamellar vesicles we show that {pUL}31 and {pUL}34 are sufficient for membrane budding and scission. {pUL}34 function can be by-passed by membrane-tethering of {pUL}31 demonstrating that {pUL}34 is required for {pUL}31 membrane recruitment but not for membrane remodelling. {pUL}31 can inwardly deform membranes by oligomerizing on their inner surface to form buds which constrict to vesicles. Thus a single viral protein can mediate all events necessary for membrane budding and abscission.},

We compare different {FLIM} methods: a chief advantage of wide-field time-gating and phase modulation methods is the speed of acquisition whereas for time-correlated single photon counting ({TCSPC}) based confocal scanning it is accuracy in the fluorescence decay. {FLIM} has been used to image interactions between proteins such as receptor oligomerisation and to reveal protein phosphorylation by detecting fluorescence resonance energy transfer ({FRET}). In addition, {FLIM} can also probe the local environment of fluorophores, reporting, for example, on the local {pH}, refractive index, ion or oxygen concentration without the need for ratiometric measurements.},

This article discusses the fundamental challenges in zebrafish long-term live imaging, provides experimental protocols and highlights key prop1erties and capabilities of advanced fluorescence microscopes.

Thus, the out-of-focus parts of the object are always in darkness, and the final photographs show high resolution throughout the depth of scan. The mechanism of scanning is somewhat similar to the Gregory?Donaldson method, whereas the mechanism of illumination is similar to that of the Schmaltz slit. This is the first time that scanning and focal plane illumination have been combined to attain high resolution at great depths.

However, the rapid divergence of a traditional Gaussian light sheet restricts the field of view ({FOV}) that provides innate subcellular resolution. We show that the Airy beam innately yields high contrast and resolution up to a tenfold larger {FOV}. In contrast to the Bessel beam, which also provides an increased {FOV}, the Airy beam's characteristic asymmetric excitation pattern results in all fluorescence contributing positively to the contrast, enabling a step change for light-sheet microscopy.},

Recent advances in optical and optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging now allow imaging at depths and resolutions unprecedented for optical methods. These abilities are increasingly important to understand the dynamic interactions of cellular processes at different systems levels, a major challenge of postgenome biology. This Review discusses promising photonic methods that have the ability to visualize cellular and subcellular components in tissues across different penetration scales. The methods are classified into microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic approaches, according to the tissue depth at which they operate. Key characteristics associated with different imaging implementations are described and the potential of these technologies in biological applications is discussed.},

Here we describe a microscope based on light-sheet illumination that allows massively parallel fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ({FCS}) measurements and use it to visualize the diffusion and interactions of proteins in mammalian cells and in isolated fly tissue. Imaging the mobility of heterochromatin protein {HP}1α (ref. 4) in cell nuclei we could provide high-resolution diffusion maps that reveal euchromatin areas with heterochromatin-like {HP}1α-chromatin interactions.

This means: a) working with a biological system that is not confined to essentially two dimensions like cell cultures on cover glasses, b) gaining intrinsic optical sectioning capabilities by an efficient three-dimensional fluorescence imaging system, and c) using arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional ablation-patterns by a plasma-induced laser ablation system that prevent damage to surrounding tissues. Spatial levels in our biological applications range from sub-microns during delicate ablation of single microtubules over the confined disruption of cell membranes in an {MDCK}-cyst to the macroscopic cutting of a millimeter-sized Zebrafish caudal fin with arbitrary three-dimensional ablation patterns. Dynamic processes like laser-induced hemocyte migration can be studied with our {SPIM}-microscalpel in intact, live embryos.},

Unlike existing light sheet microscopy protocols, our method does not require the sample to be embedded in agarose; instead, samples are prepared conventionally on glass coverslips. Tissue culture cells and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos are used as examples in this protocol; successful implementation of the protocol results in isotropic resolution and acquisition speeds up to several volumes per s on these samples. Assembling and verifying {diSPIM} performance takes ∼6 d, sample preparation and data acquisition take up to 5 d and postprocessing takes 3-8 h, depending on the size of the data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background This paper analyses the resolution achieved in localisation microscopy experiments. The resolution is an essential metric for the correct interpretation of super-resolution images, but it varies between specimens due to different localisation precisions and densities. Methods By analysing localisation microscopy as a statistical method of Density Estimation, we present a method that produces a blind estimate of the resolution in a super-resolved image. This estimate is derived directly from the raw image data without the need for comparisons with known calibration specimens. It is corroborated with simulated and experimental data. Results and discussion Localisation microscopy has a resolution limit equal to 2σ, where σ is the r.m.s. localisation precision, evaluated as an average Thompson precision, Cramer Rao bound, or otherwise. Further, for a limited-sampling case in which there is only one localisation per fluorophore, the expected resolution of an optimised super-resolution image is worsened to approximately 3σ, due to smoothing processes that are necessarily involved in visualising the specimen with limited data. This 2σ or 3σ resolution can be estimated for any localisation microscopy specimen, and this metric can corroborate or replace empirical estimates of resolution. Other quantifiable resolution losses arise from sparse labelling, fluorescent label size, and motion blur.},

The precise details of these movements, however, are sometimes elusive, because of the limitations in live imaging. To overcome this problem, we developed techniques to enable observation of living mouse embryos with digital scanned light sheet microscope ({DSLM}). The achieved deep and high time-resolution images of {GFP}-expressing nuclei and following 3D tracking analysis revealed the following findings: (i) Interkinetic nuclear migration ({INM}) occurs in the epiblast at embryonic day (E)6 and 6.5. (ii) {INM}-like migration occurs in the E5.5 embryo, when the epiblast is a monolayer and not yet pseudostratified. (iii) Primary driving force for {INM} at E6.5 is not pressure from neighboring nuclei. (iv) Mesodermal cells migrate not as a sheet but as individual cells without coordination.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate far-field fluorescence microscopy with a focal-plane resolution of 15–20 nm in biological samples. The 10- to 12-fold multilateral increase in resolution below the diffraction barrier has been enabled by the elimination of molecular triplet state excitation as a major source of photobleaching of a number of dyes in stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Allowing for relaxation of the triplet state between subsequent excitation–depletion cycles yields an up to 30-fold increase in total fluorescence signal as compared with reported stimulated emission depletion illumination schemes. Moreover, it enables the reduction of the effective focal spot area by up to ≈140-fold below that given by diffraction. Triplet-state relaxation can be realized either by reducing the repetition rate of pulsed lasers or by increasing the scanning speed such that the build-up of the triplet state is effectively prevented. This resolution in immunofluorescence imaging is evidenced by revealing nanoscale protein patterns on endosomes, the punctuated structures of intermediate filaments in neurons, and nuclear protein speckles in mammalian cells with conventional optics. The reported performance of diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy opens up a pathway for addressing fundamental problems in the life sciences.},

This instrument combines a conventional optical microscope with a free-floating or specifically bound magnetic bead used as a mechanical probe. Forces can be applied by the bead to microscopic structures of interest (specimens), while the reaction displacement of the bead is measured. This enables 3D mechanical manipulations and measurements to be performed on specimens in fluids. Force is generated by the magnetically permeable bead in reaction to fields produced by external electromagnets. The displacement is measured by interferometry using forward light scattered by the bead from a focused laser beam. The far-field interference pattern is imaged on a quadrant photodetector from which the 3D displacement can be computed over a limited range about the focal point. The bead and specimen are mounted on a 3D translation stage and feedback techniques are used to keep the bead within this limited range. We demonstrate the system with application to beads attached to cilia in human lung cell cultures.},

Using these methods, we quantitatively analyzed Arabidopsis thaliana flower development at cell resolution, which revealed differential growth patterns of key regions during early stages of floral morphogenesis.

When combined with tissue clearing methods, light sheet microscopy furthermore allows rapid imaging of large specimens with excellent coverage and high spatial resolution. Even samples up to the size of entire mammalian brains can be efficiently recorded and quantitatively analyzed.

	abstract = {Localisation microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit by measuring the position of individual molecules to obtain optical images with a lateral resolution better than 30 nm. Single molecule localisation microscopy was originally demonstrated only in two dimensions but has recently been extended to three dimensions. Here we develop a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) localisation microscopy by engineering of the point-spread function ({PSF}) of a fluorescence microscope. By introducing a linear phase gradient between the two halves of the objective pupil plane the {PSF} is split into two lateral lobes whose relative position depends on defocus. Calculations suggested that the phase gradient resulting from the very small tolerances in parallelism of conventional slides made from float glass would be sufficient to generate a two-lobed {PSF}. We demonstrate that insertion of a suitably chosen microscope slide that occupies half the objective aperture combined with a novel fast fitting algorithm for 3D localisation estimation allows nanoscopic imaging with detail resolution well below 100 nm in all three dimensions (standard deviations of 20, 16, and 42 nm in x, y, and z directions, respectively). The utility of the approach is shown by imaging the complex 3D distribution of microtubules in cardiac muscle cells that were stained with conventional near infrared fluorochromes. The straightforward optical setup, minimal hardware requirements and large axial localisation range make this approach suitable for many nanoscopic imaging applications.},

In our four-lens selective plane illumination microscope ({SPIM}) setup the development of multiple embryos is recorded in parallel and a map of all labelled cells is obtained for each embryo in {\textless}10 s. In these panoramic projections, cell segmentation and flow analysis reveal characteristic migration patterns and global tissue remodelling in the early endoderm. Merging data from many samples uncover stereotypic patterns that are fundamental to endoderm development in every embryo.

Here, using in vitro atomic force microscopy, we have directly visualized high-resolution native structures of bacterial endospores, including the exosporium and spore coats of four Bacillus species in air and water environments. Our results demonstrate that the mechanisms of spore coat self-assembly are similar to those described for inorganic and macromolecular crystallization. The dimensions of individual Bacillus atrophaeus spores decrease reversibly by 12\% in response to a change in the environment from fully hydrated to air-dried state, establishing that the dormant spore is a dynamic physical structure. The interspecies distributions of spore length and width were determined for four species of Bacillus spores in water and air environments. The dimensions of individual spores differ significantly depending upon species, growth regimes, and environmental conditions. These findings may be useful in the reconstruction of environmental and physiological conditions during spore formation and for modeling the inhalation and dispersal of spores. This study provides a direct insight into molecular architecture and structural variability of bacterial endospores as a function of spatial and developmental organizational scales.},

Recent developments in fluorescent microscopy techniques allow for novel experimental approaches to study stochastic localization, distribution and movement of fluorescently labeled molecules in high resolution as they occur over time in the context of living cells and whole organisms. Particularly suitable for such studies is the application of light sheet microscopy, as it enables rapid in vivo imaging of a wide range and size of specimen, from whole organisms and organs, down to the dynamics of subcellular structures and single molecules. This article summarizes the principles of light sheet microscopy and its advantages over other optical imaging techniques, such as light microscopy and confocal microscopy, and highlights recent innovations that significantly enhance spatio-temporal resolution. Also, this manuscript contains basic guidelines for the implementation of light sheet microscopy in the laboratory and presents thus far unpublished light sheet microscopy applications demonstrating the ability of this technology to measure protein dynamics in a whole-organism context.

	abstract = {Light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy ({LSFM}) is a fluorescence technique that combines optical sectioning, the key capability of confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopes with multiple-view imaging, which is used in optical tomography. In contrast to conventional wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopes, a light sheet illuminates only the focal plane of the detection objective lens from the side. Excitation is, thus, restricted to the fluorophores in the volume near the focal plane. This provides optical sectioning and allows the use of regular cameras in the detection process. Compared to confocal fluorescence microscopy, {LSFM} reduces photo bleaching and photo toxicity by up to three orders of magnitude. In {LSFM}, the specimen is embedded in a transparent block of hydrogel and positioned relative to the stationary light sheet using precise motorized translation and rotation stages. This feature is used to image any plane in a specimen. Additionally, multiple views obtained along different angles can be combined into a single data set with an improved resolution. {LSFMs} are very well suited for imaging large live specimens over long periods of time. However, they also perform well with very small specimens such as single yeast cells. This perspective introduces the principles of {LSFM}, explains the challenges of specimen preparation, and introduces the basics of a microscopy that takes advantage of multiple views.},

The microenvironment determines cell behavior, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood because quantitative studies of cell signaling and behavior have been challenging due to insufficient spatial and/or temporal resolution and limitations on microenvironmental control. Here we introduce microenvironmental selective plane illumination microscopy ({meSPIM}) for imaging and quantification of intracellular signaling and submicrometer cellular structures as well as large-scale cell morphological and environmental features. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the mechanical properties of the microenvironment regulate the transition of melanoma cells from actin-driven protrusion to blebbing, and we present tools to quantify how cells manipulate individual collagen fibers. We leverage the nearly isotropic resolution of {meSPIM} to quantify the local concentration of actin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling on the surfaces of cells deep within 3D collagen matrices and track the many small membrane protrusions that appear in these more physiologically relevant environments.},

A multitude of different light sheet microscopes have emerged for the noninvasive imaging of specimens ranging from single molecules to cells, tissues, and entire embryos. In particular, developmental biology can benefit from the ability to watch developmental events occur in real time in an entire embryo, thereby advancing our understanding on how cells form tissues and organs.

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, the use of light to control and manipulate microscopic particles has become widespread. These methods are enabling new areas of research to flourish across the physical and biological sciences. This thesis describes investigations into both optical trapping and the closely related field of optical sorting. It documents the development of a variety of new techniques. The thesis begins with a short review of optical trapping and existing methods for sorting mixtures of microscopic particles. The first half of this chapter highlights some of the reasons behind optical trapping's rapid growth in popularity. By reviewing an array of methods for sorting particles and discussing the relative merits of each, the case for optical sorting is established. The second chapter describes research into using a spatial light modulator to create three-dimensional optically trapped colloidal structures using the time-sharing technique. Limiting factors inherent in the technology are discussed in detail. The third chapter reviews a sophisticated particle-tracking software package that has proved to be a considerable success. It was developed explicitly with colloidal microscopy in mind and experimental plots produced by the software are used throughout the thesis. Experimental studies have been performed into the behaviour of microscopic particles moving under the influence of two classes of propagation-invariant beams: Mathieu beams and Bessel beams. The Bessel beam studies have been complimented by a theoretical model and have led ultimately to a new method for the static optical sorting of both solid particles and biological cells, with particular emphasis on human blood. The fifth and final chapter describes how re-configurable optical devices can be implemented to spatially separate different colloidal species. A new method for creating arbitrary optical landscapes using an acousto-optic modulator is reported. This new technique is then used to optically sort four particle species simultaneously - the first experimental demonstration of polydisperse optical fractionation. Additionally, experiments are reported that demonstrate controlled, static optical sorting using a spatial light modulator.},

As we gain a deeper understanding of the different cellular functions of tau, the focus shifts from the axon, where tau has a principal role as a microtubule-associated protein, to the dendrite, where it mediates amyloid-β toxicity.},

	abstract = {Cerenkov luminescence imaging ({CLI}) is an emerging hybrid modality that utilizes the light emission from many commonly used medical isotopes. Cerenkov radiation ({CR}) is produced when charged particles travel through a dielectric medium faster than the speed of light in that medium. First described in detail nearly 100 years ago, {CR} has only recently applied for biomedical imaging purposes. The modality is of considerable interest as it enables the use of widespread luminescence imaging equipment to visualize clinical diagnostic (all {PET} radioisotopes) and many therapeutic radionuclides. The amount of light detected in {CLI} applications is significantly lower than other that in other optical imaging techniques such as bioluminescence and fluorescence. However, significant advantages include the use of approved radiotracers and lack of an incident light source, resulting in high signal to background ratios. As well, multiple subjects may be imaged concurrently (up to 5 in common bioluminescent equipment), conferring both cost and time benefits. This review summarizes the field of Cerenkov luminescence imaging to date. Applications of {CLI} discussed include intraoperative radionuclide-guided surgery, monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, tomographic optical imaging capabilities, and the ability to perform multiplexed imaging using fluorophores excited by the Cerenkov radiation. While technical challenges still exist, Cerenkov imaging has materialized as an important molecular imaging modality.},

Reversible cryo-arrest was applied to study the evolution of ligand-induced receptor tyrosine kinase activation at different scales. The nanoscale clustering of epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) in the plasma membrane was assessed by single-molecule localization microscopy, and endosomal microscale activity patterns of ephrin receptor A2 ({EphA}2) were assessed by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.

Both applications indicate that the method can achieve 3D single-particle localization with a sub-pixel precision and sub-millisecond computation time. The precision is almost the same as that of the iterative nonlinear least-squares 3D Gaussian fitting method, but with two orders of magnitude higher computation speed. This approach can reduce considerably the time and costs for processing the large volume data of 3D images for 3D single-particle tracking, which is especially suited for 3D high-precision single-particle tracking, 3D single-molecule imaging and even new microscopy techniques.},

However, in order to obtain images of different planes, it has been necessary to move the sample relative to the fixed focal plane of the detection objective lens. This mechanical movement limits speed, precision and may be harmful to the sample. We have built a light-sheet microscope that uses remote focusing with an electrically tunable lens ({ETL}). Without moving specimen or objective we have thereby achieved flexible volume imaging at much higher speeds than previously reported. Our high-speed microscope delivers 3D snapshots of sensitive biological samples. As an example, we imaged 17 planes within a beating zebrafish heart at 510 frames per second, equivalent to 30 volume scans per second. Movements, shape changes and signals across the entire volume can be followed which has been impossible with existing reconstruction techniques.},

A major challenge in understanding the cellular diversity of the brain has been linking activity during behavior with standard cellular typology. For example, it has not been possible to determine whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active during distinct experiences represent separable cell types, and it is not known whether these differentially active cells exert distinct causal influences on behavior. Here, we develop quantitative hydrogel-based technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype. We find that positive and negative-valence experiences in prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations that differ in their causal impact on behavior, long-range wiring, and gene expression profiles, with the major discriminant being expression of the adaptation-linked gene {NPAS}4. These findings illuminate cellular logic of prefrontal cortex information processing and natural adaptive behavior and may point the way to cell-type-specific understanding and treatment of disease-associated states.},

The device is both compact, measuring approximately 15 by 5 by 5 cm, and cost-effective, since we employed consumer electronics and an inexpensive device molding method. We demonstrated that {PIP} provided significant contrast and resolution enhancement to conventional microscopy through imaging different multi-cellular fluorescent structures, including 3-D branched cells in vitro and live zebrafish embryos. Imaging with the integration of {PIP} greatly reduced out-of-focus contamination and generated sharper contrast in acquired 2-D plane images when compared with the stand-alone inverted microscope. As a result, the dynamic fluid domain of the beating zebrafish heart was clearly segmented and the functional monitoring of the heart was achieved. Furthermore, the enhanced axial resolution established by thin plane illumination of {PIP} enabled the 3-D reconstruction of the branched cellular structures, which leads to the improvement on the functionality of the wide field microscopy.},

	volume = {27},
	doi = {10.1091/mbc.E15-11-0764},
	abstract = {The " Applications of Cell Biology in the Real World " Minisymposium comprised two full sessions. Although the topic was overwhelmingly broad, several central themes emerged. Disease mechanisms and therapeutics permeated many of the talks, with an array of different, and often unexpected, experimental systems, new analytical tools, and model organisms also discussed. Cancer was a focus of a number of presentations, with new approaches addressing long-standing problems. Lisa Belmont (Genentech) discussed strategies for targeting the tumor suppressor {BRG}1, an {ATP}-dependent helicase frequently mutated in cancer, which is part of the {BAF} complex that remodels chromatin. Based on synthetic lethal interaction identifications, the data she discussed suggest that inactivating related helicases might be a promising strategy. Bert Gough (University of Pittsburgh) described methods for exploiting (rather than bemoaning) the broad heterogeneity among different cell types to facilitate drug discovery, focusing on investigations of signaling heterogeneity in the {IL}-6-activated {STAT}3 pathway and describing novel tools such as a " heterogeneity browser. " Hirofumi Matsui (University of Tsukubu) discussed the de-velopment of optical cell separation and culture systems that use photodegradable hydrogels, photoirradiation, and cell picking to separate cells based on morphological criteria, along with the devel-opment of automated systems useful for the study of cancer cells. Another overarching theme encompassed cell death, aging, and neurodegeneration, with numerous new tools and approaches de-scribed here as well. Vlad Denic (Harvard University) described his studies of the essential protein heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in yeast. Because Hsf1 inactivation causes protein aggregation, he used an " anchor-away " approach to acutely deplete Hsf1 in the presence of rapamycin and found that heat shock protein family members, in particular Hsp70 and Hsp90, were necessary and sufficient to allow cells to survive in the absence of Hsf1. Marc Hammarlund (Yale University) spoke about axon regeneration, using pulsed-laser axot-omy in Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model and emphasizing the critical role of inhibiting poly({ADP}-ribosylation) in stimulating regeneration. Jonny Nixon-Abell (University College London and National Institutes of Health) used emerging superresolution imag-ing approaches to clarify the distinct morphologies and dynamics of peripheral {ER} tubules and noted that important disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia are linked to proteins involved in {ER} morphology. Grazing incidence illumination ({GI})-{SIM} and lattice light sheet-point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography ({LLS}-{PAINT}) were used to reveal novel, ultrafast dynamism in the peripheral {ER} and further indicated that many structures classically considered peripheral sheets are instead dense tubular matrices. Christopher Medina (University of New Mexico) spoke about kine-sin-1 deficiency and imaging in living mouse brain, presenting tech-niques such as tracing circuitry in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging after focal manganese injection. These techniques were able to show altered axonal transport in vivo in hippocampal-to– basal forebrain memory circuits, pathogenically implicating de-creased synaptic vesicle replacement in active synapses. Moving to injury repair, Virginia Ayres (Michigan State University) identified nanoscale cues for regenerative neural cell systems, specifically for polyamide nanofiber scaffolds used in spinal cord injury repair, using specially adapted atomic force microscopy for the cues and super-resolution imaging for reactive astrocyte protein responses. A variety of neurodegenerative disorders also took center stage. Aditya Venkatesh (University of Massachusetts) spoke about retini-tis pigmentosa ({RP}), an inherited photoreceptor degenerative disor-der (with many known mutated genes in rod genes) that results in blindness from secondary loss of retinal cones. Cone survival de-pends on {mTORC}1, which has an essential role in clearance of au-tophagic aggregates. Activating {mTORC}1 by reducing {TSC}1 pro-motes long-term cone survival, prefiguring therapeutic potential to prolong vision in {RP}. Alzheimer's disease was the topic of several talks. Rylie Walsh (Brandeis University) investigated Drosophila neu-romuscular junctions to describe how perturbations in the retromer protein complex cause changes in amyloid precursor protein ({APP})– positive exosome levels. Neuronal retromer was able to rescue {APP} accumulation in a retromer mutant. Natalya Gertsik (Weill Cornell Medical College) discussed how γ-secretase inhibitors and modula-tors might be useful for Alzheimer's disease treatment via their in-ducement of distinct conformational changes within the active sites of γ-secretase and signal peptide peptidase that she identified by photophore walking. Risa Broyer (University of California, San Diego) leveraged the cell biology of metabolic enzymes to uncover new insights into orphan genetic diseases affecting metabolic path-ways, emphasizing studies of {PRPP} synthase, where filament forma-tion may be involved in pathogenesis. Infections and vascular disorders are also prominent themes in medicine, and cell biology is enlightening these areas. Meron Mengistu (University of Maryland) spoke about {HIV} vaccine devel-opment, using three-dimensional {dSTORM} microscopic visualization},

Using superresolution imaging, we confirm that fibrils consisting of endogenous and exogenous Tau are released from cells and demonstrate their potential to spread Tau pathology.

We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy ({DSLM}-{SI}) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. {DSLM}-{SI} provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development.

Using the {iDISCO} visualization method involving targeted molecular labeling, tissue clearing, and light-sheet microscopy, we studied plaque formation in the intact {AD} mouse brain at up to 27 months of age. We visualized amyloid plaques in 3D together with tau, microglia, and vasculature. Volume imaging coupled to automated detection and mapping enables precise and fast quantification of plaques within the entire intact mouse brain. The present methodology is also applicable to analysis of frozen human brain samples without specialized preservation. Remarkably, amyloid plaques in human brain tissues showed greater 3D complexity and surprisingly large three-dimensional amyloid patterns, or {TAPs}. The ability to visualize amyloid in 3D, especially in the context of their micro-environment, and the discovery of large {TAPs} may have important scientific and medical implications.},

We have monitored the dynamics of mitochondrial distribution in hamster embryos at frequent intervals over 24 h using two-photon microscopy (1,047 nm) while maintaining blastocyst, and even fetal, developmental competence. In contrast, confocal imaging for only 8 h inhibits development, even without fluorophore excitation. Photo-induced production of H2O2 may account, in part, for this inhibition. Thus, two-photon microscopy, but not confocal microscopy, has permitted long-term fluorescence observations of the dynamics of three-dimensional cytoarchitecture in highly photosensitive specimens such as mammalian embryos.},

	abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is a powerful model for studying neural development, but conventional imaging methods are either too slow or phototoxic to take full advantage of this system. To solve these problems, we developed an inverted selective plane illumination microscopy ({iSPIM}) module for noninvasive high-speed volumetric imaging of living samples. {iSPIM} is designed as a straightforward add-on to an inverted microscope, permitting conventional mounting of specimens and facilitating {SPIM} use by development and neurobiology laboratories. {iSPIM} offers a volumetric imaging rate 30× faster than currently used technologies, such as spinning-disk confocal microscopy, at comparable signal-to-noise ratio. This increased imaging speed allows us to continuously monitor the development of C, elegans embryos, scanning volumes every 2 s for the 14-h period of embryogenesis with no detectable phototoxicity. Collecting ∼25,000 volumes over the entirety of embryogenesis enabled in toto visualization of positions and identities of cell nuclei. By merging two-color {iSPIM} with automated lineaging techniques we realized two goals: (i) identification of neurons expressing the transcription factor {CEH}-10/Chx10 and (ii) visualization of their neurodevelopmental dynamics. We found that canal-associated neurons use somal translocation and amoeboid movement as they migrate to their final position in the embryo. We also visualized axon guidance and growth cone dynamics as neurons circumnavigate the nerve ring and reach their targets in the embryo. The high-speed volumetric imaging rate of {iSPIM} effectively eliminates motion blur from embryo movement inside the egg case, allowing characterization of dynamic neurodevelopmental events that were previously inaccessible.},

We present an analytical single-particle tracking ({SPT}) method and tool, multiple-target tracing ({MTT}), that takes advantage of the high spatial resolution provided by single-fluorophore sensitivity. {MTT} can be used to generate dynamic maps at high densities of tracked particles, thereby providing global representation of molecular dynamics in cell membranes. Deflation by subtracting detected peaks allows detection of lower-intensity peaks. We exhaustively detected particles using {MTT}, with performance reaching theoretical limits, and then reconnected trajectories integrating the statistical information from past trajectories. We demonstrate the potential of this method by applying it to the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) labeled with quantum dots (Qdots), in the plasma membrane of live cells. We anticipate the use of {MTT} to explore molecular dynamics and interactions at the cell membrane.},

T-cell activation critically relies on the spatiotemporal arrangements of {TCRs} on the plasma membrane. However, the molecular organizations of {TCRs} on lymph node-resident T cells have not yet been determined, owing to the diffraction limit of light. Here we visualized nanometer- and micrometer-scale {TCR} distributions in lymph nodes by light sheet direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ({dSTORM}) and structured illumination microscopy ({SIM}). This {dSTORM} and {SIM} approach provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, of multiscale reorganization of {TCRs} during in vivo immune responses. We observed nanometer-scale plasma membrane domains, known as protein islands, on naïve T cells. These protein islands were enriched within micrometer-sized surface areas that we call territories. In vivo T-cell activation caused the {TCR} territories to contract, leading to the coalescence of protein islands and formation of stable {TCR} microclusters.},

Recently, we and others have discovered that measurable visible light due to the Cerenkov effect is produced in vivo following the administration of β-emitting radionuclides to small animals. Furthermore, the amounts of injected activity required to produce a detectable signal are consistent with small-animal molecular imaging applications. This surprising observation has led to the development of a new hybrid molecular imaging modality known as Cerenkov luminescence imaging ({CLI}), which allows the spatial distribution of biomolecules labelled with β-emitting radionuclides to be imaged in vivo using sensitive charge-coupled device cameras. We review the physics of Cerenkov radiation as it relates to molecular imaging, present simulation results for light intensity and spatial distribution, and show an example of {CLI} in a mouse cancer model. {CLI} allows many common radiotracers to be imaged in widely available in vivo optical imaging systems, and, more importantly, provides a pathway for directly imaging β−-emitting radionuclides that are being developed for therapeutic applications in cancer and that are not readily imaged by existing methods.},

	abstract = {The combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging provides a powerful approach to study the morphology and biochemistry of living biological systems. For example, fluorescence spectroscopic imaging technique offers the capability to reveal the important biochemical and morphological changes during pathological processes based on unique properties of fluorescent molecules such as spectral lineshape, lifetime and anisotropy. This dissertation aims to advance the current fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy techniques for employment in basic bioscience realm, and to translate these technologies to clinical diagnostic applications. Two specific biological questions are addressed, namely the application of autofluorescence to diagnose epithelial precancer, and the use of autofluorescence to extract microvasculature in tissue  in vivo .                 In the study of fluorescence detection of precancer, we first investigated the feasibility of non-invasive monitoring cellular metabolism based on the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Then, we conducted a systematic study of the single- and two-photon excited autofluorescence from epithelial tissues. Finally, using a {DMBA} treated hamster cheek pouch model of oral cancer, we studied the noninvasive diagnosis of epithelial precancer based on multimodal two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging technique. Our study demonstrated that the morphological analysis of microscopic images provided both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the cancer development. The {NADH} fluorescence lifetime reduced with the carcinoma progression. Moreover, the nonlinear optical signals from collagen matrix provide diagnostic information for precancer differentiation. We recently discovered for the first time that hemoglobin, an essential protein molecule in blood, emits strong high-energy Soret fluorescence and can be potentially used as an endogenous contrast agent for imaging of microvasculature. We first characterized the spectral and lifetime properties of hemoglobin fluorescence by using a time-resolved spectroscopic imaging system. Then, the  in vivo  label-free three-dimensional imaging of microvasculature was performed based on the unique spectral and temporal characteristics of hemoglobin fluorescence. Finally, we explored the potential of in vivo  label-free blood count based on the {TPEF} signals from hemoglobin in erythrocytes and tryptophan in leukocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the multiphoton excitation fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy of endogenous agents has the tremendous potential to become a routine technique for life science research and clinical diagnosis of diseases.},

	abstract = {This review focuses on techniques that facilitate the visualization of protein trafficking. In the mid-1990's the cloning of {GFP} allowed fluorescently tagged proteins to be expressed in cells and then visualized in real time. This advance allowed a glimpse, for the first time, of the complex system within cells for distributing proteins. It quickly became apparent, however, that time-lapse sequences of exogenously expressed {GFP}-labeled proteins can be difficult to interpret. Reasons for this include the relatively low signal that comes from moving proteins and high background rates from stationary proteins and other sources, as well as the difficulty of identifying the origins and destinations of specific vesicular carriers. In this review we will examine a range of techniques that have overcome these issues to varying degrees and discuss the insights into protein trafficking that they have enabled. We will concentrate on neurons, as they are highly polarized and, thus, their trafficking systems tend to be accessible for study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ({STORM}) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.
Three-dimensional fluorescence images of cellular structures in fixed cells are realized at 20- to 30-nanometer lateral and 50-nanometer axial resolution, without scanning.

	abstract = {{CLARITY} is a method for chemical transformation of intact biological tissues into a hydrogel-tissue hybrid, which becomes amenable to interrogation with light and macromolecular labels while retaining fine structure and native biological molecules. This emerging accessibility of information from large intact samples has created both new opportunities and new challenges. Here we describe protocols spanning multiple dimensions of the {CLARITY} workflow, ranging from simple, reliable and efficient lipid removal without electrophoretic instrumentation (passive {CLARITY}) to optimized objectives and integration with light-sheet optics ({CLARITY}-optimized light-sheet microscopy ({COLM})) for accelerating data collection from clarified samples by several orders of magnitude while maintaining or increasing quality and resolution. The entire protocol takes from 7–28 d to complete for an adult mouse brain, including hydrogel embedding, full lipid removal, whole-brain antibody staining (which, if needed, accounts for 7–10 of the days), and whole-brain high-resolution imaging; timing within this window depends on the choice of lipid removal options, on the size of the tissue, and on the number and type of immunostaining rounds performed. This protocol has been successfully applied to the study of adult mouse, adult zebrafish and adult human brains, and it may find many other applications in the structural and molecular analysis of large assembled biological systems.},

The importance of rigorous quantitative analysis in neuroscience has long been recognized as an essential baseline against which to compare and interpret species differences, developmental changes, and pathological changes, among other processes. Counting, however, is not easy, and incorrect sampling methods have more than once produced fundamentally incorrect results – notably, the now discredited belief that there is no neuronal loss in normal aging (reviewed in Guillery, 2002), or that there are “ten times” more glia than neurons (reviewed in Hilgetag and Barbas, 2009). A particular challenge in neuroanatomy has been the problem of compiling accurate quantitative data about inherently 3-dimensional structures  from essentially 2-dimensional histological sections.  The standard way of dealing with this problem has been the application of specific stereological procedures. Even when combined with some degree of automation, however, stereology is notoriously labor intensive, and provides only limited information about spatial localization and pattern. A rapidly emerging alternative approach in quantitative neuroanatomy is direct 3-dimensional visualization. In itself, this is not new; for example, whole mount preparations reacted for various antigens have demonstrated an intricate compartmentalization of the cerebellar cortex (White et al., 2012; Cerminara et al., 2015); and reconstructed stacks of consecutive histology slides have successfully demonstrated the complex striosomal architecture (Mikula et al., 2009). The newer techniques, although not without their own problems, offer faster processing, better standardization, and the potential for integration across cellular and subcellular spatial scales.Several volumetric approaches are available. Serial two-photon tomography is a block-face approach developed in the early 2000’s and now in routine use for whole mouse brains (Ragan et al, 2012; Kim et al., 2015). The main features (reviewed in Amato et al., 2016) include straightforward specimen preparation, minimal tissue processing, automated and robust data acquisition, and high resolution 3-D reconstructions.  In confocal light sheet microscopy ({LSM}),  the approach used by Silvestri et al., the sample is illuminated with a thin sheet of light and optically sectioned, typically in a wide-field detection scheme. Millions of pixels are collected simultaneously by a camera instead of sequentially as in standard confocal or two-photon microscopy. Several modifications have been developed, each with some tradeoffs between the physical width of the lightsheet and the size of the specimen that can be imaged.  Thin lightsheets (5µm -{\textless}1µm) provide the best axial resolution, but are limited to small samples. Physical specifications and configuration are reviewed in Silvestri et al, as well as in a number of other sources, reflecting the intense interest in this burgeoning field (Reynaud et al., 2015; Richardson and Lichtman, 2015; Santi, 2011; Tomer et al., 2015).{LSM} entails a number of interrelated steps, which are clearly detailed in Silvestri et al. As shown in their figure 1, the experimental pipeline for large-volume quantitative neuroanatomy consists of tissue clearing (for which there are a number of options; see also Richardson and Lichtman, 2015), actual imaging, image stitching, automatic cell localization, and further statistical analysis.  None of these steps are routine and all are best viewed as still under development.  The Authors are careful to emphasize that what they call large-scale quantitative neuroanatomy is still in its infancy (last paragraph of the Discussion) and requires both aggressive quality control and interactive testing of visualization and annotation tools. A major factor in the new pipeline is (for neuroscientists) the unaccustomedly huge size of the datasets, requiring sophisticated analysis capabilities and a disposition for multi-disciplinary interactions (see Reynaud et al., 2015: “The technology is ready to assist biologists in tackling scientific problems, but are biologists ready for it?”).  On the positive side, these exigencies are encouraging the fast emergence of a new mindset, eager to accept the interdisciplinary challenges.Silvestri et al. take as a specific application the number and arrangement of Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum. This is an attractive target for multiple reasons: Purkinje cells are large, unambiguously identifiable by virtue of their size and location, they are moderately well-isolated, and variations have been reported in instances of human pathological conditions. The total number of Purkinje cells calculated in the selected P10 L7-{GFP} mouse is given as 221,107. This accords well with the estimates derived from unbiased stereology (e.g., Woodruff-Pak, 2006).   Silvestri et al., report further geometric data, acquired by a clustering algorithm. Setting the number of nearest neighbors equal to 3, the Authors report that 94\% of identified Purkinje cells occur in large clusters, that 1131 clusters are made up of fewer than 100 cells, and that there are 1389 isolated neurons. This analysis is reminiscent of similar spatial analysis of apical dendritic bundles in cerebral cortex. In several studies, tangential sections through cortical layer 3 have revealed an organized array of dendritic clusters, containing about 50 dendrites in humans or 30 in macaque monkeys (Peters, 1994; Gabbott, 2003). This and other quantitative/pattern questions are well-suited to re-investigation with the new, faster protocols.In summary, large-scale quantitative neuroanatomy, via 3-D data acquisition and analysis, has emerged as an important new tool. More than tool, it is spearheading a welcome “user’s group”/new community with shared interests and priorities. The energy is palpable, and bodes well for renewed attention to basic neuroanatomical issues. It effectively rebuts, via standardization and quantification, the old accusation of  neuroanatomy as “descriptive.”   Major challenges undoubtedly lie ahead.  Technical: can the current tradeoff of resolution and field width in {LSM} be narrowed? What are the effective ways for dealing with very large datasets? Sociological: how do we optimally combine the traditional small, {PI} driven lab with large centers or core facilities? Databases with ideas? Conceptual: What issues are the most tractable to this approach? How do we achieve more effective methodological integration; for example, gene expression data or receptor distribution along with cytoarchitecture? How do we incorporate cell type and connectivity data?  How do we incorporate the temporal domain? Questions notwithstanding, this is an impressive new direction, and continued progress on all fronts can be expected.},

	abstract = {We present a novel framework and experimental method for the quantification of spatial resolution of a tomography system. The framework adopts the "black box" view of an imaging system, considering only its input and output. The tomography system is locally stimulated with a step input, viz., a sharp edge. The output, viz., the reconstructed images, is analysed by Fourier decomposition of their spatial frequency components, and the local limiting spatial resolution is determined using a cut-off threshold. At no point is an observer involved in the process. The framework also includes a means of translating the quantification region in the imaging space, thus creating a spatially resolved map of objectively quantified spatial resolution. As a case-study, the framework is experimentally applied using a gaseous propane phantom measured by a well-established chemical species tomography system. A spatial resolution map consisting of 28 regions is produced. In isolated regions, the indicated performance is 4-times better than that suggested in the literature and varies by 57\% across the imaging space. A mechanism based on adjacent but non-interacting beams is hypothesised to explain the observed behaviour. The mechanism suggests that, as also independently concluded by other methods, a geometrically regular beam array maintains maximum objectivity in reconstructions. We believe that the proposed framework, methodology, and findings will be of value in the design and performance evaluation of tomographic imaging arrays and systems.},

Recently, the solutions to this problem have started to emerge based on whole-body and whole-organ clearing techniques that employ innovative tissue-clearing chemistry. Here, we review these advancements and discuss how combining new clearing techniques with high-performing fluorescent proteins or small molecule tags, rapid volume imaging and efficient image informatics is resulting in comprehensive and quantitative organ-wide, single-cell resolution experimental data.

Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species. The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope. The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarski interference contrast illumination.

However, the mechanism involved in this hierarchical pattern of disease progression is unknown. We describe a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of human tau P301L is restricted to {EC}-{II}. Tau pathology progresses from {EC} transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to {EC} neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, {CA} fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and {EC} neurons are lost. These data suggest that a sequence of progressive misfolding of tau proteins, circuit-based transfer to new cell populations, and deafferentation induced degeneration are part of a process of tau-induced neurodegeneration.},

In {AD} the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregates to form characteristic fibrillar structures, which are the deposits found as plaques in the brains of patients. We have used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, {dSTORM}, to probe the process of in situ Abeta aggregation and the morphology of the ensuing aggregates with a resolution better than 20 nm. We are able to distinguish different types of structures, including oligomeric assemblies and mature fibrils, and observe a number of morphological differences between the species formed in vitro and in vivo, which may be significant in the context of disease. Our data support the recent view that intracellular Abeta could be associated with Abeta pathogenicity in {AD}, although the major deposits are extracellular, and suggest that this approach will be widely applicable to studies of the molecular mechanisms of protein deposition diseases.},

Retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}), could be successfully tagged with {QDs} through the membrane incorporation of a short acceptor peptide ({AP}) that is susceptible to site-specific biotinylation and attachment of streptavidin-conjugated {QDs}. It was found that this {AP} tag-based {QD} labeling had little effect on the viral infectivity and allowed for the study of the kinetics of the internalization of the recombinant lentivirus enveloped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein ({VSVG}) into the early endosomes. It also allows for the live cell imaging of the trafficking of labeled virus to the Rab5(+) endosomal compartments. This study further demonstrated by direct visualization of {QD}-labeled virus that {VSVG}-pseudotyped lentivirus enters cells independent of clatherin- and caveolin-pathways, while the entry of {VSVG}-pseudotyped retrovirus occurs via the clathrin pathway. The studies monitoring {HIV} particles using {QD}-labeling showed that we could detect single virions on the surface of target cells expressing either {CD}4/{CCR}5 or {DC}-{SIGN}. Further internalization studies of {QD}-{HIV} evidently showed that the clathrin pathway is the major route for {DC}-{SIGN}-mediated uptake of viruses. Taken together, our data demonstrate the potential of this {QD}-labeling for visualizing the dynamic interactions between viruses and target cell structures.},

	abstract = {Networks of neurons give rise to behavior in complex animals. Determining the relationship between neural activity and sensory input or motor output requires recording network activity over time. Two properties contribute to the difficulty of recording from intact biological neural networks: first, the component neurons are spread across the three-dimensional volume of the brain, and second, all neurons in the network may be active simultaneously. Recently, optical techniques have enabled monitoring activity across many neurons simultaneously. However, the recording range has been limited to the field of view of imaging device, generally the 2D focal plane of a camera or scanning laser system. In order to capture activity information across the full 3D extent of the network, multiple exposures must be acquired at different focal distances, which breaks the synchrony of the activity measurements. Here, I describe a novel neural imaging technique, called light field microscopy ({LFM}), which is capable of simultaneously recording the activity of many neurons across a volume of tissue. By measuring both the spatial and the angular properties of incoming photons, {LFM} is able to capture a 3D volume with a single camera exposure. To demonstrate the efficacy of {LFM} for neural recordings, I loaded the optic tectum of the transparent larval zebrafish with fluorescent calcium-indicator dye and presented the fish with high-contrast 2D visual stimuli. Using this preparation, {LFM} produces a 4D dataset (three spatial dimensions plus the time dimension) representing the visually-evoked activity patterns across a 3D network of neurons. In this dissertation, I describe the steps required for producing 4D neural activity datasets, and compare the resulting data to that obtained using a classic two-photon scanning laser microscope. The wealth of data captured by the {LFM} increases the complexity of analysis, and thus motivated the development of a statistical method for automatically isolating interesting parts of the dataset. The method, called elastic source selection ({ESS}), can determine the relevance over time of each captured voxel to an external stimulus. This dissertation establishes the effectiveness of the {LFM} and {ESS} techniques, providing neuroscientists a new avenue into the brain.},

Instruments equipped with spectral imaging detection systems further refine the technique by enabling the examination and resolution of fluorophores with overlapping spectra as well as providing the ability to compensate for autofluorescence.

Understanding how neural information is processed in physiological and pathological states would benefit from precise detection, localization, and quantification of the activity of all neurons across the entire brain, which has not, to date, been achieved in the mammalian brain. We introduce a pipeline for high-speed acquisition of brain activity at cellular resolution through profiling immediate early gene expression using immunostaining and light-sheet fluorescence imaging, followed by automated mapping and analysis of activity by an open-source software program we term {ClearMap}. We validate the pipeline first by analysis of brain regions activated in response to haloperidol. Next, we report new cortical regions downstream of whisker-evoked sensory processing during active exploration. Last, we combine activity mapping with axon tracing to uncover new brain regions differentially activated during parenting behavior. This pipeline is widely applicable to different experimental paradigms, including animal species for which transgenic activity reporters are not readily available.},

Two movable optical elements were directly coupled, so that the zoom factor could be adjusted from 1x to 6.3x by a single motor. Using two different illumination objectives we achieved a light sheet thickness ranging from 2.4 µm to 36 µm corresponding to lateral fields of 54 µm to 12.3 mm, respectively. Polytene chromosomes of salivary gland cell nuclei of C.tentans larvae were imaged in vivo to demonstrate the advantages in image contrast by imaging with different light sheet dimensions.},

Concurrently, light-sheet microscopy, also known as selective plane illumination microscopy ({SPIM}), has gained rapid favor with the imaging community in developmental biology due to its fast speed, high contrast, deep penetration, and low phototoxicity. While nearly a dozen reviews thoroughly describe the development of light-sheet microscopy and its technological breakthroughs with a main focus on improving the 3D imaging speed of fish embryos, central nervous system, and other tissues, few have addressed the potential of combining light-sheet microscopy and localization-based super-resolution imaging to achieve sub-diffraction-limited resolution. Adapting light-sheet illumination for single-molecule imaging presents unique challenges for instrumentation and reconstruction algorithms. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of the recent developments that address these challenges. We compare different approaches in super-resolution and light-sheet imaging, address advantages and limitations in each approach, and outline future directions of this emerging field.},

	abstract = {Misfolding and aggregation of amyloidogenic polypeptides lie at the root of many neurodegenerative diseases. Whilst protein aggregation can be readily studied in vitro by established biophysical techniques, direct observation of the nature and kinetics of aggregation processes taking place in vivo is much more challenging. We describe here, however, a Förster resonance energy transfer sensor that permits the aggregation kinetics of amyloidogenic proteins to be quantified in living systems by exploiting our observation that amyloid assemblies can act as energy acceptors for variants of fluorescent proteins. The observed lifetime reduction can be attributed to fluorescence energy transfer to intrinsic energy states associated with the growing amyloid species. Indeed, for a-synuclein, a protein whose aggregation is linked to Parkinson's disease, we have used this sensor to follow the kinetics of the self-association reactions taking place in vitro and in vivo and to reveal the nature of the ensuing aggregated species. Experiments were conducted in vitro, in cells in culture and in living Caenorhabditis elegans. For the latter the readout correlates directly with the appearance of a toxic phenotype. The ability to measure the appearance and development of pathogenic amyloid species in a living animal and the ability to relate such data to similar processes observed in vitro provides a powerful new tool in the study of the pathology of the family of misfolding disorders. Our study confirms the importance of the molecular environment in which aggregation reactions take place, highlighting similarities as well as differences between the processes occurring in vitro and in vivo, and their significance for defining the molecular physiology of the diseases with which they are associated.},

However, light scattering within the sample often deteriorates the optical sectioning effect. Here, we demonstrate that contrast and degree of confocality can greatly be increased by combining scanned light sheet fluorescence excitation and confocal slit detection. A high frame rate was achieved by using the "rolling shutter" of a scientific {CMOS} camera as a slit detector. Synchronizing the "rolling shutter" with the scanned illumination beam results in confocal line detection. Acquiring image data with selective plane illumination minimizes photo-damage while simultaneously enhancing contrast, optical sectioning and signal-to-noise ratio. Thus the imaging principle presented here merges the benefits of scanned light sheet microscopy and line-scanning confocal imaging.},

Using dual-beam illumination and confocal dual-slit detection, here a dual-slit confocal {LSM} is demonstrated to obtain the {SNR} enhanced images with frame rate twice as high as line confocal {LSM} method. Through theoretical calculations and experiments, the correlation between the slit’s width and {SNR} was determined to optimize the image quality. In vivo whole brain structural imaging stacks and the functional imaging sequences of single slice were obtained for analysis of calcium activities at single-cell resolution.

Amyloidosis is a major problem in over one hundred diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}).

We visualized amyloid plaques in 3D together with tau, microglia, and vasculature. Volume imaging coupled to automated detection and mapping enables precise and fast quantification of plaques within the entire intact mouse brain. The present methodology is also applicable to analysis of frozen human brain samples without specialized preservation. Remarkably, amyloid plaques in human brain tissues showed greater 3D complexity and surprisingly large three-dimensional amyloid patterns, or {TAPs}. The ability to visualize amyloid in 3D, especially in the context of their micro-environment, and the discovery of large {TAPs} may have important scientific and medical implications.},

Earlier analyses, based on classical optical live-cell imaging, mostly restricted by technical necessity to the attached bottom surface, showed persistent formation of endocytic clathrin pits and vesicles during mitosis. Taking advantage of the resolution, speed, and non-invasive illumination of the newly developed lattice light sheet fluorescence microscope, we reexamined their assembly dynamics over the entire cell surface and showed that clathrin pits form at a lower rate during late mitosis. Full-cell imaging measurements of cell surface area and volume throughout the cell cycle of single cells in culture and in zebrafish embryos showed that the total surface increased rapidly during the transition from telophase to cytokinesis, whereas cell volume increased slightly in metaphase and remained relatively constant during cytokinesis. These applications demonstrate the advantage of lattice light sheet microscopy and enable a new standard for imaging membrane dynamics in single cells and in multicellular assemblies.},

Hence, only the fluorophores within a thin volume of the specimen are excited. This reduces photo-bleaching and photo-toxic effects by several orders of magnitude compared with any other form of microscopy. Therefore, {LSFM} (aka single/selective-plane illumination microscopy [{SPIM}] or digitally scanned light sheet microscopy [{DSLM}]) is the technique of choice for the three-dimensional imaging of live or fixed and of small or large three-dimensional specimens. The parallel recording of millions of pixels with modern cameras provides an extremely fast acquisition speed. Recent developments address the penetration depth, the resolution and the recording speed of {LSFM}. The impact of {LSFM} on research areas such as three-dimensional cell cultures, neurosciences, plant biology and developmental biology is increasing at a rapid pace. The development of high-throughput {LSFM} is the next leap forward, allowing the application of {LSFM} in toxicology and drug discovery screening.},

	abstract = {In light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy ({LSFM}), only the focal plane is illuminated by a laser light sheet. Hence, only the fluorophores within a thin volume of the specimen are excited. This reduces photo-bleaching and photo-toxic effects by several orders of magnitude compared with any other form of microscopy. Therefore, {LSFM} (aka single/selective-plane illumination microscopy [{SPIM}] or digitally scanned light sheet microscopy [{DSLM}]) is the technique of choice for the three-dimensional imaging of live or fixed and of small or large three-dimensional specimens. The parallel recording of millions of pixels with modern cameras provides an extremely fast acquisition speed. Recent developments address the penetration depth, the resolution and the recording speed of {LSFM}. The impact of {LSFM} on research areas such as three-dimensional cell cultures, neurosciences, plant biology and developmental biology is increasing at a rapid pace. The development of high-throughput {LSFM} is the next leap forward, allowing the application of {LSFM} in toxicology and drug discovery screening.},

Public exhibitions of scientific instruments can provide hands-on experience with technical advances and their applications in the life sciences. The software of such devices, however, is oftentimes not appropriate for this purpose. In this study, we describe a software framework and the necessary computer configuration that is well suited for exposing a complex self-built and software-controlled instrument such as a microscope to laymen under limited supervision, e.g. in museums or schools. We identify several aspects that must be met by such software, and we describe a design that can simultaneously be used to control either (i) a fully functional instrument in a robust and fail-safe manner, (ii) an instrument that has low-cost or only partially working hardware attached for illustration purposes or (iii) a completely virtual instrument without hardware attached. We describe how to assess the educational success of such a device, how to monitor its operation and how to facilitate its maintenance. The introduced concepts are illustrated using our software to control {eduSPIM}, a fluorescent light sheet microscope that we are currently exhibiting in a technical museum.},

In the most challenging data sets for super-resolution, such as those obtained in low-illumination live-cell imaging with {GFP}, we show that {SRRF} is generally capable of achieving resolutions better than 150 nm. Meanwhile, for data sets similar to those obtained in {PALM} or {STORM} imaging, {SRRF} achieves resolutions approaching those of standard single-molecule localization analysis. The broad applicability of {SRRF} and its performance at low signal-to-noise ratios allows super-resolution using modern widefield, confocal or {TIRF} microscopes with illumination orders of magnitude lower than methods such as {PALM}, {STORM} or {STED}.

	abstract = {Dual-view inverted selective plane illumination microscopy ({diSPIM}) enables high-speed, long-term, four-dimensional (4D) imaging with isotropic spatial resolution. It is also compatible with conventional sample mounting on glass coverslips. However, broadening of the light sheet at distances far from the beam waist and sample-induced scattering degrades {diSPIM} contrast and optical sectioning. We describe two simple improvements that address both issues and entail no additional hardware modifications to the base {diSPIM}. First, we demonstrate improved {diSPIM} sectioning by keeping the light sheet and detection optics stationary, and scanning the sample through the stationary light sheet (rather than scanning the broadening light sheet and detection plane through the stationary sample, as in conventional {diSPIM}). This stage-scanning approach allows a thinner sheet to be used when imaging laterally extended samples, such as fixed microtubules or motile mitochondria in cell monolayers, and produces finer contrast than does conventional {diSPIM}. We also used stage-scanning {diSPIM} to obtain high-quality, 4D nuclear datasets derived from an uncompressed nematode embryo, and performed lineaging analysis to track 97\% of cells until twitching. Second, we describe the improvement of contrast in thick, scattering specimens by synchronizing light-sheet synthesis with the rolling, electronic shutter of our scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({sCMOS}) detector. This maneuver forms a virtual confocal slit in the detection path, partially removing out-of-focus light. We demonstrate the applicability of our combined stage- and slit-scanning- methods by imaging pollen grains and nuclear and neuronal structures in live nematode embryos.

This has been difficult especially when the difference in cell density between the necrotic and viable zones of a tumour spheroid is small. To help overcome this problem, we developed novel one-dimensional pair-correlation functions ({PCFs}) to provide quantitative estimates of the radial distance of the necrotic zone boundary from the centre of a tumour spheroid. We validate our approach on synthetic tumour spheroids in which the position of the necrotic zone boundary is known a priori. It is then applied to nine real tumour spheroids imaged with light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy. {PCF} estimates of the necrotic zone boundary are compared with those of a human expert and an existing standard computational method.},

Particle tracking's applications and impact in drug and gene delivery research have greatly increased during the last decade. Thanks to advances in hardware and software, this technique is now more accessible than ever, and can be reliably automated to enable rapid processing of large data sets, thereby further enhancing the role that particle tracking will play in drug and gene delivery studies in the future. We begin this review by discussing particle tracking-based advances in characterizing extracellular and cellular barriers to therapeutic nanoparticles and in characterizing nanoparticle size and stability. To facilitate wider adoption of the technique, we then present a user-friendly review of state-of-the-art automated particle tracking algorithms and methods of analysis. We conclude by reviewing technological developments for next-generation particle tracking methods, and we survey future research directions in drug and gene delivery where particle tracking may be useful.},

We show that using the {KESM}, a zebrafish, less than 3 mm long and diameter less than 500 μm, can be imaged within 1 hour at a resolution of 0.6 μm × 0.7 μm × 1.0 μm. We also present new results on using a vibrating microtome to improve sectioning and imaging robustness.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence polarization microscopy ({FPM}) aims to detect the dipole orientation of fluorophores and to resolve structural information for labeled organelles via wide-field or confocal microscopy. Conventional {FPM} often suffers from the presence of a large number of molecules within the diffraction-limited volume, with averaged fluorescence polarization collected from a group of dipoles with different orientations. Here, we apply sparse deconvolution and least-squares estimation to fluorescence polarization modulation data and demonstrate a super-resolution dipole orientation mapping ({SDOM}) method that resolves the effective dipole orientation from a much smaller number of fluorescent molecules within a sub-diffraction focal area. We further apply this method to resolve structural details in both fixed and live cells. For the first time, we show that different borders of a dendritic spine neck exhibit a heterogeneous distribution of dipole orientation. Furthermore, we illustrate that the dipole is always perpendicular to the direction of actin filaments in mammalian kidney cells and radially distributed in the hourglass structure of the septin protein under specific labelling. The accuracy of the dipole orientation can be further mapped using the orientation uniform factor, which shows the superiority of {SDOM} compared with its wide-field counterpart as the number of molecules is decreased within the smaller focal area. Using the inherent feature of the orientation dipole, the {SDOM} technique, with its fast imaging speed (at sub-second scale), can be applied to a broad range of fluorescently labeled biological systems to simultaneously resolve the valuable dipole orientation information with super-resolution imaging.},

The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too.

	abstract = {Pixel count is the ratio of the solid angle within a camera/'s field of view to the solid angle covered by a single detector element. Because the size of the smallest resolvable pixel is proportional to aperture diameter and the maximum field of view is scale independent, the diffraction-limited pixel count is proportional to aperture area. At present, digital cameras operate near the fundamental limit of 1-10 megapixels for millimetre-scale apertures, but few approach the corresponding limits of 1-100 gigapixels for centimetre-scale apertures. Barriers to high-pixel-count imaging include scale-dependent geometric aberrations, the cost and complexity of gigapixel sensor arrays, and the computational and communications challenge of gigapixel image management. Here we describe the {AWARE}-2 camera, which uses a 16-mm entrance aperture to capture snapshot, one-gigapixel images at three frames per minute. {AWARE}-2 uses a parallel array of microcameras to reduce the problems of gigapixel imaging to those of megapixel imaging, which are more tractable. In cameras of conventional design, lens speed and field of view decrease as lens scale increases, but with the experimental system described here we confirm previous theoretical results suggesting that lens speed and field of view can be scale independent in microcamera-based imagers resolving up to 50 gigapixels. Ubiquitous gigapixel cameras may transform the central challenge of photography from the question of where to point the camera to that of how to mine the data.},

We have developed a light-sheet microscope that uses confocal scanning of dual-Bessel beams for illumination. A digital micromirror device ({DMD}) is placed in the intermediate image plane of the objective used to collect fluorescence and is programmed with two lines of pixels in the “on” state such that the {DMD} functions as a spatial filter to reject the out-of-focus background generated by the side-lobes of the Bessel beams. The optical sectioning and out-of-focus background rejection capabilities of this microscope were demonstrated by imaging of fluorescently stained actin in human A431 cells. The dual-Bessel beam system enables twice as many photons to be detected per imaging scan, which is useful for low light applications (e.g., single-molecule localization) or imaging at high speed with a superior signal to noise. While demonstrated for two Bessel beams, this approach is scalable to a larger number of beams.},

The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},

However, mismatches between the light-sheet and detection planes are common owing to the spatiotemporally varying optical properties of living specimens. Here we present the {AutoPilot} framework, an automated method for spatiotemporally adaptive imaging that integrates (i) a multi-view light-sheet microscope capable of digitally translating and rotating light-sheet and detection planes in three dimensions and (ii) a computational method that continuously optimizes spatial resolution across the specimen volume in real time. We demonstrate long-term adaptive imaging of entire developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Drosophila melanogaster embryos and perform adaptive whole-brain functional imaging in larval zebrafish. Our method improves spatial resolution and signal strength two to five-fold, recovers cellular and sub-cellular structures in many regions that are not resolved by non-adaptive imaging, adapts to spatiotemporal dynamics of genetically encoded fluorescent markers and robustly optimizes imaging performance during large-scale morphogenetic changes in living organisms.},

Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy ({DSLM}-{SI}) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. {DSLM}-{SI} provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development. We reconstructed cell positions over time from the Drosophila {DSLM}-{SI} data and created a fly digital embryo.

Light-sheet microscopy has emerged as the tool-of-choice for 3D characterization of rapidly evolving systems. However, to obtain a 3D image, either the sample or parts of the microscope are moved, limiting the acquisition speed. Here, we propose a novel inertia-free light-sheet-based scheme for volumetric imaging at high temporal resolution. Our approach comprises a novel combination of an acousto-optic scanner to produce tailored illumination and an acoustic-optofluidic lens, placed in the detection path to provide extended depth-of-field. Such a combination enables unsurpassed 3D imaging speeds up to 200 volumes per second. The volumetric imaging speed is limited only by the acquisition frame rate of the camera and the desired signal-to-noise ratio. Our volumetric microscope allows for invariant acquisition along the detection axis, avoiding extensive processing or complex deconvolution methods to restore image quality.},

Retinal vasculature develops in a highly orchestrated three-dimensional (3-D) sequence. The stages of retinal vascularization are highly susceptible to oxygen perturbations. We demonstrate that optical tissue clearing of intact rat retinas and light-sheet microscopy provides rapid 3-D characterization of vascular complexity during retinal development. Compared with flat mount preparations that dissect the retina and primarily image the outermost vascular layers, intact cleared retinas imaged using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy display changes in the 3-D retinal vasculature rapidly without the need for point scanning techniques. Using a severe model of retinal vascular disruption, we demonstrate that a simple metric based on Sholl analysis captures the vascular changes observed during retinal development in 3-D. Taken together, these results provide a methodology for rapidly quantifying the 3-D development of the entire rodent retinal vasculature.},

During embryonic development a first wave of hematopoiesis (independent of {HSCs}) allows the survival and growth of the embryo until birth. A second wave of hematopoiesis that will last into adulthood depends on the production of {HSCs} that begins at mid-gestation in large arteries such as the aorta. {HSC} production occurs through a hemogenic endothelial to hematopoietic transition ({EHT}) process and the formation of hematopoietic clusters in most vertebrate species. Advances in understanding {EHT}, cluster formation and {HSC} production were triggered by combined progresses made in the development of in vivo assays, microscopy, imaging and fluorescence tools. Here, we review the current knowledge on developmental hematopoiesis with a focus on the first step of {HSC} production in the aorta and how microscopic approaches have contributed to a better understanding of the vital process of blood cell formation.},

Prime examples are asymmetric cell divisions in the P lineage during early embryogenesis of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. However, due to a lack of quantitative data it has remained unclear how frequent unequal daughter cell sizes emerge in the nematode's early embryogenesis, and whether these originate from sterical or biochemical cues. Using quantitative light-sheet microscopy, we have found that about 40\% of all cell divisions in C. elegans until gastrulation generate daughter cells with significantly different volumes. Removing the embryo's rigid eggshell revealed asymmetric divisions in somatic cells to be primarily induced by steric effects. Division asymmetries in the germline remained unaltered and were correctly reproduced by a model based on a cell-size independent, eccentric displacement of the metaphase plate. Our data suggest asymmetric cell divisions to be essential for establishing important cell-cell interactions that eventually fuel a successful embryogenesis.},

However, fluorescence imaging is limited by depth of penetration and high scattering losses, which leads to low sensitivity in vivo systems for external detection. By contrast, photoacoustic ({PA}) imaging, an emerging modality, is capable of deep tissue, noninvasive imaging by combining near-infrared light excitation and ultrasound detection. Here, we show that voltage-dependent quenching of dye fluorescence leads to a reciprocal enhancement of {PA} intensity. We synthesized a near-infrared photoacoustic {VSD} ({PA}-{VSD}), whose {PA} intensity change is sensitive to membrane potential. In the polarized state, this cyanine-based probe enhances {PA} intensity while decreasing fluorescence output in a lipid vesicle membrane model. A theoretical model accounts for how the experimental {PA} intensity change depends on fluorescence and absorbance properties of the dye. These results not only demonstrate {PA} voltage sensing but also emphasize the interplay of both fluorescence and absorbance properties in the design of optimized {PA} probes. Together, our results demonstrate {PA} sensing as a potential new modality for recording and external imaging of electrophysiological and neurochemical events in the brain.},

Single molecule localisation microscopy was originally demonstrated only in two dimensions but has recently been extended to three dimensions. Here we develop a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) localisation microscopy by engineering of the point-spread function ({PSF}) of a fluorescence microscope. By introducing a linear phase gradient between the two halves of the objective pupil plane the {PSF} is split into two lateral lobes whose relative position depends on defocus. Calculations suggested that the phase gradient resulting from the very small tolerances in parallelism of conventional slides made from float glass would be sufficient to generate a two-lobed {PSF}. We demonstrate that insertion of a suitably chosen microscope slide that occupies half the objective aperture combined with a novel fast fitting algorithm for 3D localisation estimation allows nanoscopic imaging with detail resolution well below 100 nm in all three dimensions (standard deviations of 20, 16, and 42 nm in x, y, and z directions, respectively). The utility of the approach is shown by imaging the complex 3D distribution of microtubules in cardiac muscle cells that were stained with conventional near infrared fluorochromes. The straightforward optical setup, minimal hardware requirements and large axial localisation range make this approach suitable for many nanoscopic imaging applications.},

Synchronizing the "rolling shutter" with the scanned illumination beam results in confocal line detection. Acquiring image data with selective plane illumination minimizes photo-damage while simultaneously enhancing contrast, optical sectioning and signal-to-noise ratio. Thus the imaging principle presented here merges the benefits of scanned light sheet microscopy and line-scanning confocal imaging.},

Hence, only the fluorophores within a thin volume of the specimen are excited. This reduces photo-bleaching and photo-toxic effects by several orders of magnitude compared with any other form of microscopy. Therefore, {LSFM} (aka single/selective-plane illumination microscopy [{SPIM}] or digitally scanned light sheet microscopy [{DSLM}]) is the technique of choice for the three-dimensional imaging of live or fixed and of small or large three-dimensional specimens. The parallel recording of millions of pixels with modern cameras provides an extremely fast acquisition speed. Recent developments address the penetration depth, the resolution and the recording speed of {LSFM}. The impact of {LSFM} on research areas such as three-dimensional cell cultures, neurosciences, plant biology and developmental biology is increasing at a rapid pace. The development of high-throughput {LSFM} is the next leap forward, allowing the application of {LSFM} in toxicology and drug discovery screening.},

We have used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, {dSTORM}, to probe the process of in situ Abeta aggregation and the morphology of the ensuing aggregates with a resolution better than 20 nm. We are able to distinguish different types of structures, including oligomeric assemblies and mature fibrils, and observe a number of morphological differences between the species formed in vitro and in vivo, which may be significant in the context of disease.

	abstract = {The combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging provides a powerful approach to study the morphology and biochemistry of living biological systems. For example, fluorescence spectroscopic imaging technique offers the capability to reveal the important biochemical and morphological changes during pathological processes based on unique properties of fluorescent molecules such as spectral lineshape, lifetime and anisotropy. This dissertation aims to advance the current fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy techniques for employment in basic bioscience realm, and to translate these technologies to clinical diagnostic applications. Two specific biological questions are addressed, namely the application of autofluorescence to diagnose epithelial precancer, and the use of autofluorescence to extract microvasculature in tissue in vivo . In the study of fluorescence detection of precancer, we first investigated the feasibility of non-invasive monitoring cellular metabolism based on the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Then, we conducted a systematic study of the single- and two-photon excited autofluorescence from epithelial tissues. Finally, using a {DMBA} treated hamster cheek pouch model of oral cancer, we studied the noninvasive diagnosis of epithelial precancer based on multimodal two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging technique. Our study demonstrated that the morphological analysis of microscopic images provided both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the cancer development. The {NADH} fluorescence lifetime reduced with the carcinoma progression. Moreover, the nonlinear optical signals from collagen matrix provide diagnostic information for precancer differentiation. We recently discovered for the first time that hemoglobin, an essential protein molecule in blood, emits strong high-energy Soret fluorescence and can be potentially used as an endogenous contrast agent for imaging of microvasculature. We first characterized the spectral and lifetime properties of hemoglobin fluorescence by using a time-resolved spectroscopic imaging system. Then, the in vivo label-free three-dimensional imaging of microvasculature was performed based on the unique spectral and temporal characteristics of hemoglobin fluorescence. Finally, we explored the potential of in vivo label-free blood count based on the {TPEF} signals from hemoglobin in erythrocytes and tryptophan in leukocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the multiphoton excitation fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy of endogenous agents has the tremendous potential to become a routine technique for life science research and clinical diagnosis of diseases.},

We demonstrated that {PIP} provided significant contrast and resolution enhancement to conventional microscopy through imaging different multi-cellular fluorescent structures, including 3-D branched cells in vitro and live zebrafish embryos. Imaging with the integration of {PIP} greatly reduced out-of-focus contamination and generated sharper contrast in acquired 2-D plane images when compared with the stand-alone inverted microscope. As a result, the dynamic fluid domain of the beating zebrafish heart was clearly segmented and the functional monitoring of the heart was achieved. Furthermore, the enhanced axial resolution established by thin plane illumination of {PIP} enabled the 3-D reconstruction of the branched cellular structures, which leads to the improvement on the functionality of the wide field microscopy.},

For example, it has not been possible to determine whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active during distinct experiences represent separable cell types, and it is not known whether these differentially active cells exert distinct causal influences on behavior. Here, we develop quantitative hydrogel-based technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype. We find that positive and negative-valence experiences in prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations that differ in their causal impact on behavior, long-range wiring, and gene expression profiles, with the major discriminant being expression of the adaptation-linked gene {NPAS}4. These findings illuminate cellular logic of prefrontal cortex information processing and natural adaptive behavior and may point the way to cell-type-specific understanding and treatment of disease-associated states.},

Furthermore, the amounts of injected activity required to produce a detectable signal are consistent with small-animal molecular imaging applications. This surprising observation has led to the development of a new hybrid molecular imaging modality known as Cerenkov luminescence imaging ({CLI}), which allows the spatial distribution of biomolecules labelled with β-emitting radionuclides to be imaged in vivo using sensitive charge-coupled device cameras. We review the physics of Cerenkov radiation as it relates to molecular imaging, present simulation results for light intensity and spatial distribution, and show an example of {CLI} in a mouse cancer model. {CLI} allows many common radiotracers to be imaged in widely available in vivo optical imaging systems, and, more importantly, provides a pathway for directly imaging β–emitting radionuclides that are being developed for therapeutic applications in cancer and that are not readily imaged by existing methods.},

In contrast to conventional wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopes, a light sheet illuminates only the focal plane of the detection objective lens from the side. Excitation is, thus, restricted to the fluorophores in the volume near the focal plane. This provides optical sectioning and allows the use of regular cameras in the detection process. Compared to confocal fluorescence microscopy, {LSFM} reduces photo bleaching and photo toxicity by up to three orders of magnitude. In {LSFM}, the specimen is embedded in a transparent block of hydrogel and positioned relative to the stationary light sheet using precise motorized translation and rotation stages. This feature is used to image any plane in a specimen. Additionally, multiple views obtained along different angles can be combined into a single data set with an improved resolution. {LSFMs} are very well suited for imaging large live specimens over long periods of time. However, they also perform well with very small specimens such as single yeast cells.

Taking advantage of the resolution, speed, and non-invasive illumination of the newly developed lattice light sheet fluorescence microscope, we reexamined their assembly dynamics over the entire cell surface and showed that clathrin pits form at a lower rate during late mitosis. Full-cell imaging measurements of cell surface area and volume throughout the cell cycle of single cells in culture and in zebrafish embryos showed that the total surface increased rapidly during the transition from telophase to cytokinesis, whereas cell volume increased slightly in metaphase and remained relatively constant during cytokinesis.

	abstract = {Cerenkov luminescence imaging ({CLI}) is an emerging hybrid modality that utilizes the light emission from many commonly used medical isotopes. Cerenkov radiation ({CR}) is produced when charged particles travel through a dielectric medium faster than the speed of light in that medium. First described in detail nearly 100 years ago, {CR} has only recently applied for biomedical imaging purposes. The modality is of considerable interest as it enables the use of widespread luminescence imaging equipment to visualize clinical diagnostic (all {PET} radioisotopes) and many therapeutic radionuclides. The amount of light detected in {CLI} applications is significantly lower than other that in other optical imaging techniques such as bioluminescence and fluorescence. However, significant advantages include the use of approved radiotracers and lack of an incident light source, resulting in high signal to background ratios. As well, multiple subjects may be imaged concurrently (up to 5 in common bioluminescent equipment), conferring both cost and time benefits. This review summarizes the field of Cerenkov luminescence imaging to date. Applications of {CLI} discussed include intraoperative radionuclide-guided surgery, monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, tomographic optical imaging capabilities, and the ability to perform multiplexed imaging using fluorophores excited by the Cerenkov radiation. While technical challenges still exist, Cerenkov imaging has materialized as an important molecular imaging modality.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence polarization microscopy ({FPM}) aims to detect the dipole orientation of fluorophores and to resolve structural information for labeled organelles via wide-field or confocal microscopy. Conventional {FPM} often suffers from the presence of a large number of molecules within the diffraction-limited volume, with averaged fluorescence polarization collected from a group of dipoles with different orientations. Here, we apply sparse deconvolution and least-squares estimation to fluorescence polarization modulation data and demonstrate a super-resolution dipole orientation mapping ({SDOM}) method that resolves the effective dipole orientation from a much smaller number of fluorescent molecules within a sub-diffraction focal area. We further apply this method to resolve structural details in both fixed and live cells. For the first time, we show that different borders of a dendritic spine neck exhibit a heterogeneous distribution of dipole orientation. Furthermore, we illustrate that the dipole is always perpendicular to the direction of actin filaments in mammalian kidney cells and radially distributed in the hourglass structure of the septin protein under specific labelling. The accuracy of the dipole orientation can be further mapped using the orientation uniform factor, which shows the superiority of {SDOM} compared with its wide-field counterpart as the number of molecules is decreased within the smaller focal area. Using the inherent feature of the orientation dipole, the {SDOM} technique, with its fast imaging speed (at sub-second scale), can be applied to a broad range of fluorescently labeled biological systems to simultaneously resolve the valuable dipole orientation information with super-resolution imaging.},

Coupled with light-sheet microscopy, this approach allows unparalleled insight into the regulation of signaling pathways and cellular processes from a spatial and temporal perspective in vivo. To develop this method, we investigated the spatial and temporal regulation of canonical Wnt signaling during anterior-posterior patterning of the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. Cryptochrome C (Cry2) from Arabidopsis Thaliana was fused to {mCherry} fluorescent protein and Drosophila β-catenin to form an easy to visualize optogenetic switch. Blue light illumination caused reversible oligomerization of the fusion protein and inhibited downstream Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo. Temporal inactivation of β-catenin showed that Wnt signaling is required not only for Drosophila patterning formation, but also for maintenance throughout development. By applying light-sheet microscopy to activate the pathway and then record subsequent behavior in toto, we show precise spatial regulation of Wnt signaling in vivo. We anticipate that this method will be easily extendable to other developmental signaling pathways and many other experimental systems.},

	abstract = {Dual-view inverted selective plane illumination microscopy ({diSPIM}) enables high-speed, long-term, four-dimensional (4D) imaging with isotropic spatial resolution. It is also compatible with conventional sample mounting on glass coverslips. However, broadening of the light sheet at distances far from the beam waist and sample-induced scattering degrades {diSPIM} contrast and optical sectioning. We describe two simple improvements that address both issues and entail no additional hardware modifications to the base {diSPIM}. First, we demonstrate improved {diSPIM} sectioning by keeping the light sheet and detection optics stationary, and scanning the sample through the stationary light sheet (rather than scanning the broadening light sheet and detection plane through the stationary sample, as in conventional {diSPIM}). This stage-scanning approach allows a thinner sheet to be used when imaging laterally extended samples, such as fixed microtubules or motile mitochondria in cell monolayers, and produces finer contrast than does conventional {diSPIM}. We also used stage-scanning {diSPIM} to obtain high-quality, 4D nuclear datasets derived from an uncompressed nematode embryo, and performed lineaging analysis to track 97\% of cells until twitching. Second, we describe the improvement of contrast in thick, scattering specimens by synchronizing light-sheet synthesis with the rolling, electronic shutter of our scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({sCMOS}) detector. This maneuver forms a virtual confocal slit in the detection path, partially removing out-of-focus light. We demonstrate the applicability of our combined stage- and slit-scanning- methods by imaging pollen grains and nuclear and neuronal structures in live nematode embryos.

	abstract = {Biomedical scientists have invested significant effort into making it easy to perform lots of experiments quickly and cheaply. These “high throughput” methods are the workhorses of modern “systems biology” efforts. However, we simply cannot perform an experiment for every possible combination of different cell type, genetic mutation and other conditions. In practice this has led researchers to either exhaustively test a few conditions or targets, or to try to pick the experiments that best allow a particular problem to be explored. But which experiments should we pick? The ones we think we can predict the outcome of accurately, the ones for which we are uncertain what the results will be, or a combination of the two? Humans are not particularly well suited for this task because it requires reasoning about many possible outcomes at the same time. However, computers are much better at handling statistics for many experiments, and machine learning algorithms allow computers to “learn” how to make predictions and decisions based on the data they've previously processed. Previous computer simulations showed that a machine learning approach termed “active learning” could do a good job of picking a series of experiments to perform in order to efficiently learn a model that predicts the results of experiments that were not done. Now, Naik et al. have performed cell biology experiments in which experiments were chosen by an active learning algorithm and then performed using liquid handling robots and an automated microscope. The key idea behind the approach is that you learn more from an experiment you can't predict (or that you predicted incorrectly) than from just confirming your confident predictions. The results of the robot-driven experiments showed that the active learning approach outperforms strategies a human might use, even when the potential outcomes of individual experiments are not known beforehand. The next challenge is to apply these methods to reduce the cost of achieving the goals of large projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Light-sheet microscopy is ideal for such samples as it records high-contrast images of entire planes within large samples at once. However, in order to obtain images of different planes, it has been necessary to move the sample relative to the fixed focal plane of the detection objective lens. This mechanical movement limits speed, precision and may be harmful to the sample. We have built a light-sheet microscope that uses remote focusing with an electrically tunable lens ({ETL}). Without moving specimen or objective we have thereby achieved flexible volume imaging at much higher speeds than previously reported. Our high-speed microscope delivers 3D snapshots of sensitive biological samples. As an example, we imaged 17 planes within a beating zebrafish heart at 510 frames per second, equivalent to 30 volume scans per second. Movements, shape changes and signals across the entire volume can be followed which has been impossible with existing reconstruction techniques.},

Force is generated by the magnetically permeable bead in reaction to fields produced by external electromagnets. The displacement is measured by interferometry using forward light scattered by the bead from a focused laser beam. The far-field interference pattern is imaged on a quadrant photodetector from which the 3D displacement can be computed over a limited range about the focal point.

	abstract = {The ever-increasing speed and resolution of modern microscopes make the storage and post-processing of images challenging and prevent thorough statistical analyses in developmental biology. Here, instead of deploying massive storage and computing power, we exploit the spherical geometry of zebrafish embryos by computing a radial maximum intensity projection in real time with a 240-fold reduction in data rate. In our four-lens selective plane illumination microscope ({SPIM}) setup the development of multiple embryos is recorded in parallel and a map of all labelled cells is obtained for each embryo in \${\textless}\$10 s. In these panoramic projections, cell segmentation and flow analysis reveal characteristic migration patterns and global tissue remodelling in the early endoderm. Merging data from many samples uncover stereotypic patterns that are fundamental to endoderm development in every embryo. We demonstrate that processing and compressing raw image data in real time is not only efficient but indispensable for image-based systems biology.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background This paper analyses the resolution achieved in localisation microscopy experiments. The resolution is an essential metric for the correct interpretation of super-resolution images, but it varies between specimens due to different localisation precisions and densities. Methods By analysing localisation microscopy as a statistical method of Density Estimation, we present a method that produces a blind estimate of the resolution in a super-resolved image. This estimate is derived directly from the raw image data without the need for comparisons with known calibration specimens. It is corroborated with simulated and experimental data. Results and discussion Localisation microscopy has a resolution limit equal to 2σ, where σ is the r.m.s. localisation precision, evaluated as an average Thompson precision, Cramer Rao bound, or otherwise. Further, for a limited-sampling case in which there is only one localisation per fluorophore, the expected resolution of an optimised super-resolution image is worsened to approximately 3σ, due to smoothing processes that are necessarily involved in visualising the specimen with limited data. This 2σ or 3σ resolution can be estimated for any localisation microscopy specimen, and this metric can corroborate or replace empirical estimates of resolution. Other quantifiable resolution losses arise from sparse labelling, fluorescent label size, and motion blur.},

After removal of the mechanical load, the cell shape recovers only incompletely to its original undeformed configuration. Here, we show that incomplete shape recovery is due to an additive plastic deformation that displays the same power-law dynamics as the fully reversible viscoelastic deformation response. Moreover, the plastic deformation is a constant fraction of the total cell deformation and originates from bond ruptures within the cytoskeleton. A simple extension of the prevailing viscoelastic power-law response theory with a plastic element correctly predicts the cell behaviour under cyclic loading. Our findings show that plastic energy dissipation during cell deformation is tightly linked to elastic cytoskeletal stresses, which suggests the existence of an adaptive mechanism that protects the cell against mechanical damage.},

Tau pathology progresses from {EC} transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to {EC} neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, {CA} fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and {EC} neurons are lost.

We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the mechanical properties of the microenvironment regulate the transition of melanoma cells from actin-driven protrusion to blebbing, and we present tools to quantify how cells manipulate individual collagen fibers. We leverage the nearly isotropic resolution of {meSPIM} to quantify the local concentration of actin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling on the surfaces of cells deep within 3D collagen matrices and track the many small membrane protrusions that appear in these more physiologically relevant environments.},

The cell behaviors revealed by activated or inhibitory versions of these {GTPases} in native tissue were clearly distinct from those previously documented in cultured fibroblasts. The dynamic properties and polarity of protrusive activity, along with lamellipodia formation, were controlled by the two {GTPases} operating in a partially redundant manner, while Rho and Rac contributed separately to cell shape and filopodia formation.

The success of this promising technology has mainly been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for mounting fragile samples. Embedding zebrafish embryos in agarose, which is common in conventional confocal microscopy, has resulted in severe growth defects and unreliable results. In this study, we systematically quantified the viability and mobility of zebrafish embryos mounted under more suitable conditions. We found that tubes made of fluorinated ethylene propylene ({FEP}) filled with low concentrations of agarose or methylcellulose provided an optimal balance between sufficient confinement of the living embryo in a physiological environment over 3 days and optical clarity suitable for fluorescence imaging. We also compared the effect of different concentrations of Tricaine on the development of zebrafish and provide guidelines for its optimal use depending on the application. Our results will make light sheet microscopy techniques applicable to more fields of developmental biology, in particular the multiview long-term imaging of zebrafish embryos and other small organisms. Furthermore, the refinement of sample preparation for in toto and in vivo imaging will promote other emerging optical imaging techniques, such as optical projection tomography ({OPT}).},

	title = {Imaging Three Dimensional Visually-Evoked Calcium Dynamics in Larval Zebrafish Optic Tectum Using Light Field Microscopy},
	abstract = {Networks of neurons give rise to behavior in complex animals. Determining the relationship between neural activity and sensory input or motor output requires recording network activity over time. Two properties contribute to the difficulty of recording from intact biological neural networks: first, the component neurons are spread across the three-dimensional volume of the brain, and second, all neurons in the network may be active simultaneously. Recently, optical techniques have enabled monitoring activity across many neurons simultaneously. However, the recording range has been limited to the field of view of imaging device, generally the 2D focal plane of a camera or scanning laser system. In order to capture activity information across the full 3D extent of the network, multiple exposures must be acquired at different focal distances, which breaks the synchrony of the activity measurements. Here, I describe a novel neural imaging technique, called light field microscopy ({LFM}), which is capable of simultaneously recording the activity of many neurons across a volume of tissue. By measuring both the spatial and the angular properties of incoming photons, {LFM} is able to capture a 3D volume with a single camera exposure. To demonstrate the efficacy of {LFM} for neural recordings, I loaded the optic tectum of the transparent larval zebrafish with fluorescent calcium-indicator dye and presented the fish with high-contrast 2D visual stimuli. Using this preparation, {LFM} produces a 4D dataset (three spatial dimensions plus the time dimension) representing the visually-evoked activity patterns across a 3D network of neurons. In this dissertation, I describe the steps required for producing 4D neural activity datasets, and compare the resulting data to that obtained using a classic two-photon scanning laser microscope. The wealth of data captured by the {LFM} increases the complexity of analysis, and thus motivated the development of a statistical method for automatically isolating interesting parts of the dataset. The method, called elastic source selection ({ESS}), can determine the relevance over time of each captured voxel to an external stimulus. This dissertation establishes the effectiveness of the {LFM} and {ESS} techniques, providing neuroscientists a new avenue into the brain.},

The zebrafish brain is particularly attractive for neuroimaging due to its small size, numerous translucent strains, and distinct forebrain organization. In this chapter we discuss the range of imaging techniques which have been utilized to examine the zebrafish brain. While many of these methods have only begun to be utilized in zebrafish, correlating neuroimaging phenotypes with behaviour in zebrafish has a bright future.},

We validate our approach on synthetic tumour spheroids in which the position of the necrotic zone boundary is known a priori.

The magnetic tweezers described here combines both aspects in a single apparatus: high forces in a controllable direction. To this end, micron scale magnetic structures are fabricated using cleanroom technologies. With these tweezers, magnetic flux gradients of \${\textbackslash}nabla\$B = 8 × 103 T m-1 can be achieved over the dimensions of a single cell. This allows exertion of forces up to 12 {pN} on paramagnetic probes with a diameter of 350 nm, enabling us to maneuver them through the cytoplasm of a living cell. It is expected that with the current tweezers, {picoNewton} forces can be exerted on beads as small as 100 nm.},

	abstract = {Highly multiplexed single-molecule {FISH} has emerged as a promising approach to spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics because of its ability to directly image and profile numerous {RNA} species in their native cellular context. However, background—from off-target binding of {FISH} probes and cellular autofluorescence—can become limiting in a number of important applications, such as increasing the degree of multiplexing, imaging shorter {RNAs}, and imaging tissue samples. Here, we developed a sample clearing approach for {FISH} measurements. We identified off-target binding of {FISH} probes to cellular components other than {RNA}, such as proteins, as a major source of background. To remove this source of background, we embedded samples in polyacrylamide, anchored {RNAs} to this polyacrylamide matrix, and cleared cellular proteins and lipids, which are also sources of autofluorescence. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we measured the copy number of 130 {RNA} species in cleared samples using multiplexed error-robust {FISH} ({MERFISH}). We observed a reduction both in the background because of off-target probe binding and in the cellular autofluorescence without detectable loss in {RNA}. This process led to an improved detection efficiency and detection limit of {MERFISH}, and an increased measurement throughput via extension of {MERFISH} into four color channels. We further demonstrated {MERFISH} measurements of complex tissue samples from the mouse brain using this matrix-imprinting and -clearing approach. We envision that this method will improve the performance of a wide range of in situ hybridization-based techniques in both cell culture and tissues.},

	abstract = {Summary Understanding how mechanics complement bio-signaling in defining patterns during morphogenesis is an outstanding challenge. Here, we utilize the multicellular polyp Hydra to investigate the role of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in morphogenesis. We find that the supra-cellular actin fiber organization is inherited from the parent Hydra and determines the body axis in regenerating tissue segments. This form of structural inheritance is non-trivial because of the tissue folding and dynamic actin reorganization involved. We further show that the emergence of multiple body axes can be traced to discrepancies in actin fiber alignment at early stages of the regeneration process. Mechanical constraints induced by anchoring regenerating Hydra on stiff wires suppressed the emergence of multiple body axes, highlighting the importance of mechanical feedbacks in defining and stabilizing the body axis. Together, these results constitute an important step toward the development of an integrated view of morphogenesis that incorporates mechanics.},

We show that this new technique allows optical sectioning of fixed mouse brains with cellular resolution and can be used to detect single {GFP}-labeled neurons in excised mouse hippocampi. We obtained three-dimensional (3D) images of dendritic trees and spines of populations of {CA}1 neurons in isolated hippocampi. Also in fruit flies and in mouse embryos, we were able to visualize details of the anatomy by imaging autofluorescence.

The achieved deep and high time-resolution images of {GFP}-expressing nuclei and following 3D tracking analysis revealed the following findings: (i) Interkinetic nuclear migration ({INM}) occurs in the epiblast at embryonic day (E)6 and 6.5.

Earlier analyses, based on classical optical live-cell imaging, mostly restricted by technical necessity to the attached bottom surface, showed persistent formation of endocytic clathrin pits and vesicles during mitosis. Taking advantage of the resolution, speed, and non-invasive illumination of the newly developed lattice light sheet fluorescence microscope, we reexamined their assembly dynamics over the entire cell surface and showed that clathrin pits form at a lower rate during late mitosis. Full-cell imaging measurements of cell surface area and volume throughout the cell cycle of single cells in culture and in zebrafish embryos showed that the total surface increased rapidly during the transition from telophase to cytokinesis, whereas cell volume increased slightly in metaphase and remained relatively constant during cytokinesis. These applications demonstrate the advantage of lattice light sheet microscopy and enable a new standard for imaging membrane dynamics in single cells and in multicellular assemblies.},

	abstract = {This paper describes and gives some of the results of using a microscope which increases the useful depth of observation of an object in a photograph to many times the focal depth of the lens system being used. The principle of the microscope is that the object is illuminated only on the focal plane while the object is being scanned through that plane. Thus, the out-of-focus parts of the object are always in darkness, and the final photographs show high resolution throughout the depth of scan. The mechanism of scanning is somewhat similar to the Gregory?Donaldson method, whereas the mechanism of illumination is similar to that of the Schmaltz slit. This is the first time that scanning and focal plane illumination have been combined to attain high resolution at great depths. Of course, high-frequency scanning would permit direct observation by eye.},

In this study, we describe a software framework and the necessary computer configuration that is well suited for exposing a complex self-built and software-controlled instrument such as a microscope to laymen under limited supervision, e.g. in museums or schools. We identify several aspects that must be met by such software, and we describe a design that can simultaneously be used to control either (i) a fully functional instrument in a robust and fail-safe manner, (ii) an instrument that has low-cost or only partially working hardware attached for illustration purposes or (iii) a completely virtual instrument without hardware attached. We describe how to assess the educational success of such a device, how to monitor its operation and how to facilitate its maintenance. The introduced concepts are illustrated using our software to control {eduSPIM}, a fluorescent light sheet microscope that we are currently exhibiting in a technical museum.},

	doi = {10.1091/mbc.E15-11-0764},
	abstract = {The " Applications of Cell Biology in the Real World " Minisymposium comprised two full sessions. Although the topic was overwhelmingly broad, several central themes emerged. Disease mechanisms and therapeutics permeated many of the talks, with an array of different, and often unexpected, experimental systems, new analytical tools, and model organisms also discussed. Cancer was a focus of a number of presentations, with new approaches addressing long-standing problems. Lisa Belmont (Genentech) discussed strategies for targeting the tumor suppressor {BRG}1, an {ATP}-dependent helicase frequently mutated in cancer, which is part of the {BAF} complex that remodels chromatin. Based on synthetic lethal interaction identifications, the data she discussed suggest that inactivating related helicases might be a promising strategy. Bert Gough (University of Pittsburgh) described methods for exploiting (rather than bemoaning) the broad heterogeneity among different cell types to facilitate drug discovery, focusing on investigations of signaling heterogeneity in the {IL}-6-activated {STAT}3 pathway and describing novel tools such as a " heterogeneity browser. " Hirofumi Matsui (University of Tsukubu) discussed the de-velopment of optical cell separation and culture systems that use photodegradable hydrogels, photoirradiation, and cell picking to separate cells based on morphological criteria, along with the devel-opment of automated systems useful for the study of cancer cells. Another overarching theme encompassed cell death, aging, and neurodegeneration, with numerous new tools and approaches de-scribed here as well. Vlad Denic (Harvard University) described his studies of the essential protein heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in yeast. Because Hsf1 inactivation causes protein aggregation, he used an " anchor-away " approach to acutely deplete Hsf1 in the presence of rapamycin and found that heat shock protein family members, in particular Hsp70 and Hsp90, were necessary and sufficient to allow cells to survive in the absence of Hsf1. Marc Hammarlund (Yale University) spoke about axon regeneration, using pulsed-laser axot-omy in Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model and emphasizing the critical role of inhibiting poly({ADP}-ribosylation) in stimulating regeneration. Jonny Nixon-Abell (University College London and National Institutes of Health) used emerging superresolution imag-ing approaches to clarify the distinct morphologies and dynamics of peripheral {ER} tubules and noted that important disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia are linked to proteins involved in {ER} morphology. Grazing incidence illumination ({GI})-{SIM} and lattice light sheet-point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography ({LLS}-{PAINT}) were used to reveal novel, ultrafast dynamism in the peripheral {ER} and further indicated that many structures classically considered peripheral sheets are instead dense tubular matrices. Christopher Medina (University of New Mexico) spoke about kine-sin-1 deficiency and imaging in living mouse brain, presenting tech-niques such as tracing circuitry in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging after focal manganese injection. These techniques were able to show altered axonal transport in vivo in hippocampal-to– basal forebrain memory circuits, pathogenically implicating de-creased synaptic vesicle replacement in active synapses. Moving to injury repair, Virginia Ayres (Michigan State University) identified nanoscale cues for regenerative neural cell systems, specifically for polyamide nanofiber scaffolds used in spinal cord injury repair, using specially adapted atomic force microscopy for the cues and super-resolution imaging for reactive astrocyte protein responses. A variety of neurodegenerative disorders also took center stage. Aditya Venkatesh (University of Massachusetts) spoke about retini-tis pigmentosa ({RP}), an inherited photoreceptor degenerative disor-der (with many known mutated genes in rod genes) that results in blindness from secondary loss of retinal cones. Cone survival de-pends on {mTORC}1, which has an essential role in clearance of au-tophagic aggregates. Activating {mTORC}1 by reducing {TSC}1 pro-motes long-term cone survival, prefiguring therapeutic potential to prolong vision in {RP}. Alzheimer's disease was the topic of several talks. Rylie Walsh (Brandeis University) investigated Drosophila neu-romuscular junctions to describe how perturbations in the retromer protein complex cause changes in amyloid precursor protein ({APP})– positive exosome levels. Neuronal retromer was able to rescue {APP} accumulation in a retromer mutant. Natalya Gertsik (Weill Cornell Medical College) discussed how γ-secretase inhibitors and modula-tors might be useful for Alzheimer's disease treatment via their in-ducement of distinct conformational changes within the active sites of γ-secretase and signal peptide peptidase that she identified by photophore walking. Risa Broyer (University of California, San Diego) leveraged the cell biology of metabolic enzymes to uncover new insights into orphan genetic diseases affecting metabolic path-ways, emphasizing studies of {PRPP} synthase, where filament forma-tion may be involved in pathogenesis. Infections and vascular disorders are also prominent themes in medicine, and cell biology is enlightening these areas. Meron Mengistu (University of Maryland) spoke about {HIV} vaccine devel-opment, using three-dimensional {dSTORM} microscopic visualization},

A general feature of most of the techniques based on photoactivated localization microscopy ({PALM}) or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ({STORM}) has been the use of thin biological samples in combination with total internal reflection, thus limiting the imaging depth to a fraction of an optical wavelength. However, to study whole cells or organelles that are typically up to 15 μm deep into the cell, the extension of these methods to a three-dimensional (3D) super resolution technique is required. Here, we report an advance in optical microscopy that enables imaging of protein distributions in cells with a lateral localization precision better than 50 nm at multiple imaging planes deep in biological samples. The approach is based on combining the lateral super resolution provided by {PALM} with two-photon temporal focusing that provides optical sectioning. We have generated super-resolution images over an axial range of \${\textbackslash}approx\$10 μm in both mitochondrially labeled fixed cells, and in the membranes of living S2 Drosophila cells.},

Among the physical properties, extracellular stiffness has been shown to have direct effects on fate determination in several cell types in vitro . However, little evidence exists concerning whether shifts in stiffness occur in vivo during tissue development. To address this question, we present a systematic strategy to evaluate the shift in stiffness in a developing tissue using the mouse embryonic cerebral cortex as an experimental model. We combined atomic force microscopy measurements of tissue and cellular stiffness with immunostaining of specific markers of neural differentiation to correlate the value of stiffness with the characteristic features of tissues and cells in the developing brain. We found that the stiffness of the ventricular and subventricular zones increases gradually during development. Furthermore, a peak in tissue stiffness appeared in the intermediate zone at E16.5. The stiffness of the cortical plate showed an initial increase but decreased at E18.5, although the cellular stiffness of neurons monotonically increased in association with the maturation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. These results indicate that tissue stiffness cannot be solely determined by the stiffness of the cells that constitute the tissue. Taken together, our method profiles the stiffness of living tissue and cells with defined characteristics and can therefore be utilized to further understand the role of stiffness as a physical factor that determines cell fate during the formation of the cerebral cortex and other tissues.},

	doi = {10.1002/cphc.201000996},
	abstract = {Misfolding and aggregation of amyloidogenic polypeptides lie at the root of many neurodegenerative diseases. Whilst protein aggregation can be readily studied in vitro by established biophysical techniques, direct observation of the nature and kinetics of aggregation processes taking place in vivo is much more challenging. We describe here, however, a Förster resonance energy transfer sensor that permits the aggregation kinetics of amyloidogenic proteins to be quantified in living systems by exploiting our observation that amyloid assemblies can act as energy acceptors for variants of fluorescent proteins. The observed lifetime reduction can be attributed to fluorescence energy transfer to intrinsic energy states associated with the growing amyloid species. Indeed, for a-synuclein, a protein whose aggregation is linked to Parkinson's disease, we have used this sensor to follow the kinetics of the self-association reactions taking place in vitro and in vivo and to reveal the nature of the ensuing aggregated species. Experiments were conducted in vitro, in cells in culture and in living Caenorhabditis elegans. For the latter the readout correlates directly with the appearance of a toxic phenotype. The ability to measure the appearance and development of pathogenic amyloid species in a living animal and the ability to relate such data to similar processes observed in vitro provides a powerful new tool in the study of the pathology of the family of misfolding disorders. Our study confirms the importance of the molecular environment in which aggregation reactions take place, highlighting similarities as well as differences between the processes occurring in vitro and in vivo, and their significance for defining the molecular physiology of the diseases with which they are associated.},

	abstract = {The mechanism by which cells control directional persistence during migration is a major question. However, the common index measuring directional persistence, namely the ratio of displacement to trajectory length, is biased, particularly by cell speed. An unbiased method is to calculate direction autocorrelation as a function of time. This function depends only on the angles of the vectors tangent to the trajectory. This method has not been widely used, because it is more difficult to compute. Here we discuss biases of the classical index and introduce a custom-made open-source computer program, {DiPer}, which calculates direction autocorrelation. In addition, {DiPer} also plots and calculates other essential parameters to analyze cell migration in two dimensions: it displays cell trajectories individually and collectively, and it calculates average speed and mean square displacements ({MSDs}) to assess the area explored by cells over time. This user-friendly program is executable through Microsoft Excel, and it generates plots of publication-level quality. The protocol takes \${\textbackslash}sim\$15 min to complete. We have recently used {DiPer} to analyze cell migration of three different mammalian cell types in 2D cultures: the mammary carcinoma cell line {MDA}-{MB}-231, the motile amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and fish-scale keratocytes. {DiPer} can potentially be used not only for random migration in 2D but also for directed migration and for migration in 3D (direction autocorrelation only). Moreover, it can be used for any types of tracked particles: cellular organelles, bacteria and whole organisms.},

Using dual-beam illumination and confocal dual-slit detection, here a dual-slit confocal {LSM} is demonstrated to obtain the {SNR} enhanced images with frame rate twice as high as line confocal {LSM} method. Through theoretical calculations and experiments, the correlation between the slit's width and {SNR} was determined to optimize the image quality. In vivo whole brain structural imaging stacks and the functional imaging sequences of single slice were obtained for analysis of calcium activities at single-cell resolution. A two-fold increase in imaging speed of conventional confocal {LSM} makes it possible to capture the sequence of the neurons' activities and help reveal the potential functional connections in the whole zebrafish's brain.},

These interactions lead to the complex network dynamics that underlie neural computation which, in turn, forms the basis of cognition, perception and consciousness. In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months. Recently, the limits of what can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the design of molecular contrast agents.},

	title = {Optical Sorting and Manipulation of Microscopic Particles Graham Milne Particles},
	abstract = {Over the last few decades, the use of light to control and manipulate microscopic particles has become widespread. These methods are enabling new areas of research to flourish across the physical and biological sciences. This thesis describes investigations into both optical trapping and the closely related field of optical sorting. It documents the development of a variety of new techniques. The thesis begins with a short review of optical trapping and existing methods for sorting mixtures of microscopic particles. The first half of this chapter highlights some of the reasons behind optical trapping's rapid growth in popularity. By reviewing an array of methods for sorting particles and discussing the relative merits of each, the case for optical sorting is established. The second chapter describes research into using a spatial light modulator to create three-dimensional optically trapped colloidal structures using the time-sharing technique. Limiting factors inherent in the technology are discussed in detail. The third chapter reviews a sophisticated particle-tracking software package that has proved to be a considerable success. It was developed explicitly with colloidal microscopy in mind and experimental plots produced by the software are used throughout the thesis. Experimental studies have been performed into the behaviour of microscopic particles moving under the influence of two classes of propagation-invariant beams: Mathieu beams and Bessel beams. The Bessel beam studies have been complimented by a theoretical model and have led ultimately to a new method for the static optical sorting of both solid particles and biological cells, with particular emphasis on human blood. The fifth and final chapter describes how re-configurable optical devices can be implemented to spatially separate different colloidal species. A new method for creating arbitrary optical landscapes using an acousto-optic modulator is reported. This new technique is then used to optically sort four particle species simultaneously - the first experimental demonstration of polydisperse optical fractionation. Additionally, experiments are reported that demonstrate controlled, static optical sorting using a spatial light modulator.},

Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy ({DSLM}-{SI}) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. {DSLM}-{SI} provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development.

By investigating three different classes of refractive index inhomogeneity, using two large glass spheres, a cluster of smaller spheres and a piece of human skin, respectively, we show that beam self-reconstruction is indeed possible. We demonstrate that a Bessel beam is unexpectedly robust against deflection at objects, and we define measures for self-reconstruction in this context. We present a prototype of a microscope with self-reconstructing beams ({MISERB}) and show that a holographically shaped, scanned Bessel beam not only reduces scattering artefacts, but also simultaneously increases image quality and penetration depth in dense media.},

The optical sectioning and out-of-focus background rejection capabilities of this microscope were demonstrated by imaging of fluorescently stained actin in human A431 cells. The dual-Bessel beam system enables twice as many photons to be detected per imaging scan, which is useful for low light applications (e.g., single-molecule localization) or imaging at high speed with a superior signal to noise. While demonstrated for two Bessel beams, this approach is scalable to a larger number of beams.},

To solve these problems, we developed an inverted selective plane illumination microscopy ({iSPIM}) module for noninvasive high-speed volumetric imaging of living samples. {iSPIM} is designed as a straightforward add-on to an inverted microscope, permitting conventional mounting of specimens and facilitating {SPIM} use by development and neurobiology laboratories. {iSPIM} offers a volumetric imaging rate 30× faster than currently used technologies, such as spinning-disk confocal microscopy, at comparable signal-to-noise ratio. This increased imaging speed allows us to continuously monitor the development of C, elegans embryos, scanning volumes every 2 s for the 14-h period of embryogenesis with no detectable phototoxicity. Collecting \${\textbackslash}sim\$25,000 volumes over the entirety of embryogenesis enabled in toto visualization of positions and identities of cell nuclei. By merging two-color {iSPIM} with automated lineaging techniques we realized two goals: (i) identification of neurons expressing the transcription factor {CEH}-10/Chx10 and (ii) visualization of their neurodevelopmental dynamics. We found that canal-associated neurons use somal translocation and amoeboid movement as they migrate to their final position in the embryo. We also visualized axon guidance and growth cone dynamics as neurons circumnavigate the nerve ring and reach their targets in the embryo. The high-speed volumetric imaging rate of {iSPIM} effectively eliminates motion blur from embryo movement inside the egg case, allowing characterization of dynamic neurodevelopmental events that were previously inaccessible.},

	abstract = {The development of new biological and chemical instruments for research and diagnostic applications is often slowed by the cost, specialization, and custom nature of these instruments. New instruments are built from components that are drawn from a host of different disciplines and not designed to integrate together, and once built, an instrument typically performs a limited number of tasks and cannot be easily adapted for new applications. Consequently, the process of inventing new instruments is very inefficient, especially for researchers or clinicians in resource-limited settings. To improve this situation, we propose that a family of standardized multidisciplinary components is needed, a set of “building blocks” that perform a wide array of different tasks and are designed to integrate together. Using these components, scientists, engineers, and clinicians would be able to build custom instruments for their own unique needs quickly and easily. In this work we present the foundation of this set of components, a system we call Multifluidic Evolutionary Components ({MECs}). “Multifluidic” conveys the wide range of fluid volumes {MECs} operate upon (from nanoliters to milliliters and beyond); “multi” also reflects the multiple disciplines supported by the system (not only fluidics but also electronics, optics, and mechanics). “Evolutionary” refers to the design principles that enable the library of {MEC} parts to easily grow and adapt to new applications. Each {MEC} “building block” performs a fundamental function that is commonly found in biological or chemical instruments, functions like valving, pumping, mixing, controlling, and sensing. Each {MEC} also has a unique symbol linked to a physical definition, which enables instruments to be designed rapidly and efficiently using schematics. As a proof-of-concept, we use {MECs} to build a variety of instruments, including a fluidic routing and mixing system capable of manipulating fluid volumes over five orders of magnitude, an acid-base titration instrument suitable for use in schools, and a bioreactor suitable for maintaining and analyzing cell cultures in research and diagnostic applications.

	doi = {10.1002/cm.21274},
	abstract = {This review focuses on techniques that facilitate the visualization of protein trafficking. In the mid-1990's the cloning of {GFP} allowed fluorescently tagged proteins to be expressed in cells and then visualized in real time. This advance allowed a glimpse, for the first time, of the complex system within cells for distributing proteins. It quickly became apparent, however, that time-lapse sequences of exogenously expressed {GFP}-labeled proteins can be difficult to interpret. Reasons for this include the relatively low signal that comes from moving proteins and high background rates from stationary proteins and other sources, as well as the difficulty of identifying the origins and destinations of specific vesicular carriers. In this review we will examine a range of techniques that have overcome these issues to varying degrees and discuss the insights into protein trafficking that they have enabled. We will concentrate on neurons, as they are highly polarized and, thus, their trafficking systems tend to be accessible for study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

We demonstrate its validity and benefits on two-dimensional (2D) and 3D localization microscopy images of tubulin and actin filaments. Our {FRC} resolution method makes it possible to compare achieved resolutions in images taken with different nanoscopy methods, to optimize and rank different emitter localization and labeling strategies, to define a stopping criterion for data acquisition, to describe image anisotropy and heterogeneity, and even to estimate the average number of localizations per emitter. Our findings challenge the current focus on obtaining the best localization precision, showing instead how the best image resolution can be achieved as fast as possible.},

Adapting light-sheet illumination for single-molecule imaging presents unique challenges for instrumentation and reconstruction algorithms. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of the recent developments that address these challenges.

However, fluorescence imaging is limited by depth of penetration and high scattering losses, which leads to low sensitivity in vivo systems for external detection. By contrast, photoacoustic ({PA}) imaging, an emerging modality, is capable of deep tissue, noninvasive imaging by combining near-infrared light excitation and ultrasound detection. Here, we show that voltage-dependent quenching of dye fluorescence leads to a reciprocal enhancement of {PA} intensity. We synthesized a near-infrared photoacoustic {VSD} ({PA}-{VSD}), whose {PA} intensity change is sensitive to membrane potential. In the polarized state, this cyanine-based probe enhances {PA} intensity while decreasing fluorescence output in a lipid vesicle membrane model. A theoretical model accounts for how the experimental {PA} intensity change depends on fluorescence and absorbance properties of the dye. These results not only demonstrate {PA} voltage sensing but also emphasize the interplay of both fluorescence and absorbance properties in the design of optimized {PA} probes. Together, our results demonstrate {PA} sensing as a potential new modality for recording and external imaging of electrophysiological and neurochemical events in the brain.},

We optimized the assay for the identification of autophagy modulators in three dimensions with U343 glioma cell spheroids, which represent a more realistic cancer model than conventional 2D cell cultures. We validated the assay by screening a library of known autophagy modulators. As the first application, a small library of 94 natural compounds was screened for its impact on autophagy. We discovered the cyclic ionophore nonactin as a new and potent autophagy inducer. This novel autophagy screening assay based on 3D tumor spheroids is robust, reproducible, and scalable.

Here, we report a strategy to design tough transparent and conductive bonding of synthetic hydrogels containing 90\% water to non-porous surfaces of diverse solids, including glass, silicon, ceramics, titanium and aluminium. The design strategy is to anchor the long-chain polymer networks of tough hydrogels covalently to non-porous solid surfaces, which can be achieved by the silanation of such surfaces. Compared with physical interactions, the chemical anchorage results in a higher intrinsic work of adhesion and in significant energy dissipation of bulk hydrogel during detachment, which lead to interfacial toughness values over 1,000 J m-2. We also demonstrate applications of robust hydrogel–solid hybrids, including hydrogel superglues, mechanically protective hydrogel coatings, hydrogel joints for robotic structures and robust hydrogel–metal conductors.},

The technology can be considered to be an imaging-based counterpart to palpation, commonly used by physicians to diagnose and characterize diseases. The success of palpation as a diagnostic method is based on the fact that the mechanical properties of tissues are often dramatically affected by the presence of disease processes such as cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. {MRE} obtains information about the stiffness of tissue by assessing the propagation of mechanical waves through the tissue with a special magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) technique. The technique essentially involves three steps: generating shear waves in the tissue, acquiring {MR} images depicting the propagation of the induced shear waves and processing the images of the shear waves to generate quantitative maps of tissue stiffness, called elastograms. {MRE} is already being used clinically for the assessment of patients with chronic liver diseases and is emerging as a safe, reliable and noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for staging hepatic fibrosis. {MRE} is also being investigated for application to pathologies of other organs including the brain, breast, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, lungs and skeletal muscle.

	abstract = {The ability of fast and single-neuron resolution imaging of neural activities enables light-sheet fluorescence microscopy ({LSFM}) as a powerful imaging technique in functional neural connection applications. The state-of-art {LSFM} imaging system can record the neuronal activities of entire brain for small animal, such as zebrafish or C. elegans at single-neuron resolution. However, the stimulated and spontaneous movements in animal brain result in inconsistent neuron positions during recording process. It is time consuming to register the acquired large-scale images with conventional method. In this work, we address the problem of fast registration of neural positions in stacks of {LSFM} images. This is necessary to register brain structures and activities. To achieve fast registration of neural activities, we present a rigid registration architecture by implementation of Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU}). In this approach, the image stacks were preprocessed on {GPU} by mean stretching to reduce the computation effort. The present image was registered to the previous image stack that considered as reference. A fast Fourier transform ({FFT}) algorithm was used for calculating the shift of the image stack. The calculations for image registration were performed in different threads while the preparation functionality was refactored and called only once by the master thread. We implemented our registration algorithm on {NVIDIA} Quadro K4200 {GPU} under Compute Unified Device Architecture ({CUDA}) programming environment. The experimental results showed that the registration computation can speed-up to 550ms for a full high-resolution brain image. Our approach also has potential to be used for other dynamic image registrations in biomedical applications.},

Here, we utilize the multicellular polyp Hydra to investigate the role of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in morphogenesis. We find that the supra-cellular actin fiber organization is inherited from the parent Hydra and determines the body axis in regenerating tissue segments. This form of structural inheritance is non-trivial because of the tissue folding and dynamic actin reorganization involved. We further show that the emergence of multiple body axes can be traced to discrepancies in actin fiber alignment at early stages of the regeneration process. Mechanical constraints induced by anchoring regenerating Hydra on stiff wires suppressed the emergence of multiple body axes, highlighting the importance of mechanical feedbacks in defining and stabilizing the body axis. Together, these results constitute an important step toward the development of an integrated view of morphogenesis that incorporates mechanics.},

Ongoing advances have enabled new experimental capabilities using light to inspect the nervous system across multiple spatial scales, including ultrastructural scales finer than the optical diffraction limit. Other progress permits functional imaging at faster speeds, at greater depths in brain tissue, and over larger tissue volumes than previously possible. Portable, miniaturized fluorescence microscopes now allow brain imaging in freely behaving mice. Complementary progress on animal preparations has enabled imaging in head-restrained behaving animals, as well as time-lapse microscopy studies in the brains of live subjects. Mouse genetic approaches permit mosaic and inducible fluorescence-labeling strategies, whereas intrinsic contrast mechanisms allow in vivo imaging of animals and humans without use of exogenous markers. This review surveys such advances and highlights emerging capabilities of particular interest to neuroscientists.},

	abstract = {Peeking in on osteoprogenitors The eyes may be the windows to the soul, but a window into the bone—specifically bone marrow—would be useful for studying bone development and disease. Greenbaum et al. developed a method of whole-bone optical clearing, using a series of reagents under continuous flow to delipidate and decalcify bone tissue. This process renders the entire bone transparent but does not affect endogenous fluorescence, making this compatible with reporter mice. Using light sheet fluorescence microscopy, the authors counted and mapped the number of fluorescently labeled osteoprogenitors within cleared mouse tibia, vertebral column, and femur bones treated with sclerostin antibody. With reduced variability compared to standard section analysis, this Bone {CLARITY} and computational analysis will be a useful tool for bone research. Bone tissue harbors unique and essential physiological processes, such as hematopoiesis, bone growth, and bone remodeling. To enable visualization of these processes at the cellular level in an intact environment, we developed “Bone {CLARITY},” a bone tissue clearing method. We used Bone {CLARITY} and a custom-built light-sheet fluorescence microscope to detect the endogenous fluorescence of Sox9-{tdTomato}+ osteoprogenitor cells in the tibia, femur, and vertebral column of adult transgenic mice. To obtain a complete distribution map of these osteoprogenitor cells, we developed a computational pipeline that semiautomatically detects individual Sox9-{tdTomato}+ cells in their native three-dimensional environment. Our computational method counted all labeled osteoprogenitor cells without relying on sampling techniques and displayed increased precision when compared with traditional stereology techniques for estimating the total number of these rare cells. We demonstrate the value of the clearing-imaging pipeline by quantifying changes in the population of Sox9-{tdTomato}–labeled osteoprogenitor cells after sclerostin antibody treatment. Bone tissue clearing is able to provide fast and comprehensive visualization of biological processes in intact bone tissue. Bone clearing and light-sheet microscopy enables visualization and quantification of fluorescent single cells in intact bone.

Our results demonstrate that the mechanisms of spore coat self-assembly are similar to those described for inorganic and macromolecular crystallization. The dimensions of individual Bacillus atrophaeus spores decrease reversibly by 12\% in response to a change in the environment from fully hydrated to air-dried state, establishing that the dormant spore is a dynamic physical structure. The interspecies distributions of spore length and width were determined for four species of Bacillus spores in water and air environments. The dimensions of individual spores differ significantly depending upon species, growth regimes, and environmental conditions. These findings may be useful in the reconstruction of environmental and physiological conditions during spore formation and for modeling the inhalation and dispersal of spores. This study provides a direct insight into molecular architecture and structural variability of bacterial endospores as a function of spatial and developmental organizational scales.},

Here we visualized nanometer- and micrometer-scale {TCR} distributions in lymph nodes by light sheet direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ({dSTORM}) and structured illumination microscopy ({SIM}). This {dSTORM} and {SIM} approach provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, of multiscale reorganization of {TCRs} during in vivo immune responses. We observed nanometer-scale plasma membrane domains, known as protein islands, on naïve T cells. These protein islands were enriched within micrometer-sized surface areas that we call territories. In vivo T-cell activation caused the {TCR} territories to contract, leading to the coalescence of protein islands and formation of stable {TCR} microclusters.},

	abstract = {It was light microscopy that first revealed the hidden world of bacteria and the unit of life the “cell.” From these first observations, made in the late 1600s, it has been clear that seeing is an important tool in biology. The merging of the fields of fluorescence and microscopy created the possibility to see subcellular structures and proteins. In the 1990s the use of the confocal microscopes, where cells/tissue could be optically sectioned, further improved the resolution of object visualization. From this microworld view we now move forward to the exciting prospects of the nanoworld view of biology. In this review I propose a nanoimaging approach, nanoscopy, which could be used to reveal cell architecture at the level of proteins and protein complexes. Nanoscopy includes, the F-techniques, superresolution microscopy, correlative light and electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. To illustrate the biology that could be investigated by nanoscopy we focus on structures formed at the actin-membrane interface. In particular, focal adhesions and stress fibres have been analyzed using nanoscopy. Many of the proteins present in focal adhesions and stress fibres are shared with structures such as filopodia, lamellipodia, endocytic vesicles, actin pedestals and invadopodia. It is likely that nanoscopy of cells will reveal mechanistic details of biology at the level of individual proteins and protein complexes and importantly in a physiological context.},

Transgenic Parhyale embryos with fluorescently labeled nuclei were imaged at high spatiotemporal resolution with multi-view light-sheet fluorescence microscopy over several days of embryogenesis spanning appendage morphogenesis from early specification up to late differentiation stages. Cell tracking with a new tool called Massive Multi-view Tracker ({MaMuT}) enabled the reconstruction of the complete cell lineage of an outgrowing thoracic limb with single-cell resolution. In silico clonal analyses suggested that the limb primordium becomes subdivided from an early stage first into anterior-posterior and then into dorsal-ventral compartments whose boundaries intersect at the distal tip of the growing limb. Limb bud formation is associated with the spatial modulation of cell proliferation, while limb elongation is also driven by the preferential orientation of division of epidermal cells along the proximal-distal axis of growth. Cellular reconstructions were predictive of the expression patterns of limb development genes including the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen.},

Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy allows high-speed 3D live fluorescence imaging of living cellular and multicellular specimens with nearly isotropic spatial resolution, low photobleaching and low photodamage. Unlike conventional fluorescence imaging techniques that usually have a unique operation mode, Bessel plane illumination has several modes that offer different performance with different imaging metrics. To achieve optimal results from this technique, the appropriate operation mode needs to be selected and the experimental setting must be optimized for the specific application and associated sample properties. Here we explain the fundamental working principles of this technique, discuss the pros and cons of each operational mode and show through examples how to optimize experimental parameters. We also describe the procedures needed to construct, align and operate a Bessel beam plane illumination microscope by using our previously reported system as an example, and we list the necessary equipment to build such a microscope.

In these panoramic projections, cell segmentation and flow analysis reveal characteristic migration patterns and global tissue remodelling in the early endoderm. Merging data from many samples uncover stereotypic patterns that are fundamental to endoderm development in every embryo.

	abstract = {We demonstrate far-field fluorescence microscopy with a focal-plane resolution of 15–20 nm in biological samples. The 10- to 12-fold multilateral increase in resolution below the diffraction barrier has been enabled by the elimination of molecular triplet state excitation as a major source of photobleaching of a number of dyes in stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Allowing for relaxation of the triplet state between subsequent excitation–depletion cycles yields an up to 30-fold increase in total fluorescence signal as compared with reported stimulated emission depletion illumination schemes. Moreover, it enables the reduction of the effective focal spot area by up to \${\textbackslash}approx\$140-fold below that given by diffraction. Triplet-state relaxation can be realized either by reducing the repetition rate of pulsed lasers or by increasing the scanning speed such that the build-up of the triplet state is effectively prevented. This resolution in immunofluorescence imaging is evidenced by revealing nanoscale protein patterns on endosomes, the punctuated structures of intermediate filaments in neurons, and nuclear protein speckles in mammalian cells with conventional optics. The reported performance of diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy opens up a pathway for addressing fundamental problems in the life sciences.},

Here we describe protocols spanning multiple dimensions of the {CLARITY} workflow, ranging from simple, reliable and efficient lipid removal without electrophoretic instrumentation (passive {CLARITY}) to optimized objectives and integration with light-sheet optics ({CLARITY}-optimized light-sheet microscopy ({COLM})) for accelerating data collection from clarified samples by several orders of magnitude while maintaining or increasing quality and resolution. The entire protocol takes from 7–28 d to complete for an adult mouse brain, including hydrogel embedding, full lipid removal, whole-brain antibody staining (which, if needed, accounts for 7–10 of the days), and whole-brain high-resolution imaging; timing within this window depends on the choice of lipid removal options, on the size of the tissue, and on the number and type of immunostaining rounds performed. This protocol has been successfully applied to the study of adult mouse, adult zebrafish and adult human brains, and it may find many other applications in the structural and molecular analysis of large assembled biological systems.},

Using giant unilamellar vesicles we show that {pUL}31 and {pUL}34 are sufficient for membrane budding and scission. {pUL}34 function can be by-passed by membrane-tethering of {pUL}31 demonstrating that {pUL}34 is required for {pUL}31 membrane recruitment but not for membrane remodelling. {pUL}31 can inwardly deform membranes by oligomerizing on their inner surface to form buds which constrict to vesicles.

	doi = {10.1063/1.4913922},
	abstract = {We present a novel framework and experimental method for the quantification of spatial resolution of a tomography system. The framework adopts the "black box" view of an imaging system, considering only its input and output. The tomography system is locally stimulated with a step input, viz., a sharp edge. The output, viz., the reconstructed images, is analysed by Fourier decomposition of their spatial frequency components, and the local limiting spatial resolution is determined using a cut-off threshold. At no point is an observer involved in the process. The framework also includes a means of translating the quantification region in the imaging space, thus creating a spatially resolved map of objectively quantified spatial resolution. As a case-study, the framework is experimentally applied using a gaseous propane phantom measured by a well-established chemical species tomography system. A spatial resolution map consisting of 28 regions is produced. In isolated regions, the indicated performance is 4-times better than that suggested in the literature and varies by 57\% across the imaging space. A mechanism based on adjacent but non-interacting beams is hypothesised to explain the observed behaviour. The mechanism suggests that, as also independently concluded by other methods, a geometrically regular beam array maintains maximum objectivity in reconstructions. We believe that the proposed framework, methodology, and findings will be of value in the design and performance evaluation of tomographic imaging arrays and systems.},

Conventional {FPM} often suffers from the presence of a large number of molecules within the diffraction-limited volume, with averaged fluorescence polarization collected from a group of dipoles with different orientations. Here, we apply sparse deconvolution and least-squares estimation to fluorescence polarization modulation data and demonstrate a super-resolution dipole orientation mapping ({SDOM}) method that resolves the effective dipole orientation from a much smaller number of fluorescent molecules within a sub-diffraction focal area. We further apply this method to resolve structural details in both fixed and live cells. For the first time, we show that different borders of a dendritic spine neck exhibit a heterogeneous distribution of dipole orientation. Furthermore, we illustrate that the dipole is always perpendicular to the direction of actin filaments in mammalian kidney cells and radially distributed in the hourglass structure of the septin protein under specific labelling. The accuracy of the dipole orientation can be further mapped using the orientation uniform factor, which shows the superiority of {SDOM} compared with its wide-field counterpart as the number of molecules is decreased within the smaller focal area. Using the inherent feature of the orientation dipole, the {SDOM} technique, with its fast imaging speed (at sub-second scale), can be applied to a broad range of fluorescently labeled biological systems to simultaneously resolve the valuable dipole orientation information with super-resolution imaging.},

These software modules are open source. They provide high data throughput using a single computer workstation and are readily applicable to a wide spectrum of biological model systems.},

	abstract = {The precise localization of nanometric objects in three dimensions is essential to identify functional diffusion mechanisms in complex systems at the cellular or molecular level. However, most optical methods can achieve high temporal resolution and high localization precision only in two dimensions or over a limited axial (z) range. Here we develop a novel wide-field detection system based on an electrically tunable lens that can track multiple individual nanoscale emitters in three dimensions over a tunable axial range with nanometric localization precision. The optical principle of the technique is based on the simultaneous acquisition of two images with an extended depth of field while encoding the z position of the emitters via a lateral shift between images. We provide a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate tracking of free diffusing beads and {GABAA} receptors in live neurons. This approach allows getting nanometric localization precision up to an axial range above 10 μm with a high numerical aperture lens—quadruple that of a typical 3D tracking system. Synchronization or complex fitting procedures are not requested here, which leads to a suitable architecture for localizing single molecules in four dimensions, namely, three dimensions in real-time.},

One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.},

The advent of single molecule techniques over the past two decades has revolutionized the field of cell biology by providing a more quantitative picture of the complex and highly dynamic organization of living systems. Amongst these techniques, single particle tracking ({SPT}) has emerged as a powerful approach to study a variety of dynamic processes in life sciences. {SPT} provides access to single molecule behavior in the natural context of living cells, thereby allowing a complete statistical characterization of the system under study. In this review we describe the foundations of {SPT} together with novel optical implementations that nowadays allow the investigation of single molecule dynamic events with increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution using molecular densities closer to physiological expression levels. We outline some of the algorithms for the faithful reconstruction of {SPT} trajectories as well as data analysis, and highlight biological examples where the technique has provided novel insights into the role of diffusion regulating cellular function. The last part of the review concentrates on different theoretical models that describe anomalous transport behavior and ergodicity breaking observed from {SPT} studies in living cells.},

Because the size of the smallest resolvable pixel is proportional to aperture diameter and the maximum field of view is scale independent, the diffraction-limited pixel count is proportional to aperture area. At present, digital cameras operate near the fundamental limit of 1-10{\textbackslash},megapixels for millimetre-scale apertures, but few approach the corresponding limits of 1-100{\textbackslash},gigapixels for centimetre-scale apertures. Barriers to high-pixel-count imaging include scale-dependent geometric aberrations, the cost and complexity of gigapixel sensor arrays, and the computational and communications challenge of gigapixel image management. Here we describe the {AWARE}-2 camera, which uses a 16-mm entrance aperture to capture snapshot, one-gigapixel images at three frames per minute. {AWARE}-2 uses a parallel array of microcameras to reduce the problems of gigapixel imaging to those of megapixel imaging, which are more tractable. In cameras of conventional design, lens speed and field of view decrease as lens scale increases, but with the experimental system described here we confirm previous theoretical results suggesting that lens speed and field of view can be scale independent in microcamera-based imagers resolving up to 50 gigapixels. Ubiquitous gigapixel cameras may transform the central challenge of photography from the question of where to point the camera to that of how to mine the data.},

	abstract = {This study reports a general method of labeling enveloped viruses with semiconductor quantum dots ({QDs}) for use in single virus trafficking studies. Retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}), could be successfully tagged with {QDs} through the membrane incorporation of a short acceptor peptide ({AP}) that is susceptible to site-specific biotinylation and attachment of streptavidin-conjugated {QDs}. It was found that this {AP} tag-based {QD} labeling had little effect on the viral infectivity and allowed for the study of the kinetics of the internalization of the recombinant lentivirus enveloped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein ({VSVG}) into the early endosomes. It also allows for the live cell imaging of the trafficking of labeled virus to the Rab5(+) endosomal compartments. This study further demonstrated by direct visualization of {QD}-labeled virus that {VSVG}-pseudotyped lentivirus enters cells independent of clatherin- and caveolin-pathways, while the entry of {VSVG}-pseudotyped retrovirus occurs via the clathrin pathway. The studies monitoring {HIV} particles using {QD}-labeling showed that we could detect single virions on the surface of target cells expressing either {CD}4/{CCR}5 or {DC}-{SIGN}. Further internalization studies of {QD}-{HIV} evidently showed that the clathrin pathway is the major route for {DC}-{SIGN}-mediated uptake of viruses. Taken together, our data demonstrate the potential of this {QD}-labeling for visualizing the dynamic interactions between viruses and target cell structures.},

We demonstrate long-term adaptive imaging of entire developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Drosophila melanogaster embryos and perform adaptive whole-brain functional imaging in larval zebrafish. Our method improves spatial resolution and signal strength two to five-fold, recovers cellular and sub-cellular structures in many regions that are not resolved by non-adaptive imaging, adapts to spatiotemporal dynamics of genetically encoded fluorescent markers and robustly optimizes imaging performance during large-scale morphogenetic changes in living organisms.},

Prime examples are asymmetric cell divisions in the P lineage during early embryogenesis of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. However, due to a lack of quantitative data it has remained unclear how frequent unequal daughter cell sizes emerge in the nematode's early embryogenesis, and whether these originate from sterical or biochemical cues. Using quantitative light-sheet microscopy, we have found that about 40\% of all cell divisions in C. elegans until gastrulation generate daughter cells with significantly different volumes. Removing the embryo's rigid eggshell revealed asymmetric divisions in somatic cells to be primarily induced by steric effects. Division asymmetries in the germline remained unaltered and were correctly reproduced by a model based on a cell-size independent, eccentric displacement of the metaphase plate. Our data suggest asymmetric cell divisions to be essential for establishing important cell-cell interactions that eventually fuel a successful embryogenesis.},

We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ({STORM}) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures. Three-dimensional fluorescence images of cellular structures in fixed cells are realized at 20- to 30-nanometer lateral and 50-nanometer axial resolution, without scanning.

Cells involved in adaptive immunity mature later and have therefore been difficult to access optically in intact animals. Thus, the study of many aspects of vertebrate infection requires dissection of adult organs or ex vivo isolation of immune cells. Recently, {CLARITY} and {PACT} (passive clarity technique) methodologies have enabled clearing and direct visualization of dissected organs. Here, we show that these techniques can be applied to image host-pathogen interactions directly in whole animals. {CLARITY} and {PACT}-based clearing of whole adult zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis -infected mouse lungs enables imaging of mycobacterial granulomas deep within tissue to a depth of more than 1{\textbackslash}hspace0.25emmm. Using established transgenic lines, we were able to image normal and pathogenic structures and their surrounding host context at high resolution. We identified the three-dimensional organization of granuloma-associated angiogenesis, an important feature of mycobacterial infection, and characterized the induction of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}) within the granuloma using an established fluorescent reporter line. We observed heterogeneity in {TNF} induction within granuloma macrophages, consistent with an evolving view of the tuberculous granuloma as a non-uniform, heterogeneous structure. Broad application of this technique will enable new understanding of host-pathogen interactions in situ .},

Unlike popular wide-field and confocal methods, plane-illumination microscopy limits excitation to the information-rich vicinity of the focal plane, providing effective optical sectioning and high speed while minimizing out-of-focus background and premature photobleaching. Here we used scanned Bessel beams in conjunction with structured illumination and/or two-photon excitation to create thinner light sheets (\${\textless}\$0.5 μm) better suited to three-dimensional (3D) subcellular imaging. As demonstrated by imaging the dynamics of mitochondria, filopodia, membrane ruffles, intracellular vesicles and mitotic chromosomes in live cells, the microscope currently offers 3D isotropic resolution down to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde0.3 μm, speeds up to nearly 200 image planes per second and the ability to noninvasively acquire hundreds of 3D data volumes from single living cells encompassing tens of thousands of image frames.},

Time-lapse microscopic imaging of transgenic embryos expressing fluorescent reporters is the method of choice for tracking morphogenetic changes and establishing cell lineages and fate maps in vivo . However, the manual steps involved in curating thousands of putative cell segmentations have been a major bottleneck in the application of these technologies especially for cell membranes. Segmentation of cell membranes while more difficult than nuclear segmentation is necessary for quantifying the relations between changes in cell morphology and morphogenesis. We present a novel and fully automated method to first reconstruct membrane signals and then segment out cells from 3D membrane images even in dense tissues. The approach has three stages: 1) detection of local membrane planes, 2) voting to fill structural gaps, and 3) region segmentation. We demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithms quantitatively on time-lapse confocal and two-photon images of zebrafish neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm by comparing its results with those derived from human inspection. We also compared with synthetic microscopic images generated by simulating the process of imaging with fluorescent reporters under varying conditions of noise. Both the over-segmentation and under-segmentation percentages of our method are around 5\%. The volume overlap of individual cells, compared to expert manual segmentation, is consistently over 84\%. By using our software ({ACME}) to study somite formation, we were able to segment touching cells with high accuracy and reliably quantify changes in morphogenetic parameters such as cell shape and size, and the arrangement of epithelial and mesenchymal cells.

Here we develop a novel wide-field detection system based on an electrically tunable lens that can track multiple individual nanoscale emitters in three dimensions over a tunable axial range with nanometric localization precision. The optical principle of the technique is based on the simultaneous acquisition of two images with an extended depth of field while encoding the z position of the emitters via a lateral shift between images. We provide a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate tracking of free diffusing beads and {GABAA} receptors in live neurons. This approach allows getting nanometric localization precision up to an axial range above 10 μm with a high numerical aperture lens—quadruple that of a typical 3D tracking system. Synchronization or complex fitting procedures are not requested here, which leads to a suitable architecture for localizing single molecules in four dimensions, namely, three dimensions in real-time.},

	abstract = {A commentary {onQuantitative} neuroanatomy of all Purkinje cells with light sheet microscopy and high-throughput image analysisby Silvestri, L., Paciscopi, M., Soda, P., Biamonte, F., Iannello, G., Frasconi, P., and Pavone, F.S. (2015). Front. Neuroanat. 9:68. doi: 10.3389/fnana.2015.00068“Contemporary neuroscience is in urgent need of a new generation of neuroanatomical techniques allowing scalable, reliable, specific, and quantitative analysis of macroscopic portions of brain tissue with cellular or sub-cellular resolution.” In this first sentence of their Discussion, Silvestri et al (2015) succinctly set forth the key issues of their contributing article; namely, visualization of Purkinje cells in 3-D volumes, and the methods for doing so. The importance of rigorous quantitative analysis in neuroscience has long been recognized as an essential baseline against which to compare and interpret species differences, developmental changes, and pathological changes, among other processes. Counting, however, is not easy, and incorrect sampling methods have more than once produced fundamentally incorrect results – notably, the now discredited belief that there is no neuronal loss in normal aging (reviewed in Guillery, 2002), or that there are “ten times” more glia than neurons (reviewed in Hilgetag and Barbas, 2009). A particular challenge in neuroanatomy has been the problem of compiling accurate quantitative data about inherently 3-dimensional structures from essentially 2-dimensional histological sections. The standard way of dealing with this problem has been the application of specific stereological procedures. Even when combined with some degree of automation, however, stereology is notoriously labor intensive, and provides only limited information about spatial localization and pattern. A rapidly emerging alternative approach in quantitative neuroanatomy is direct 3-dimensional visualization. In itself, this is not new; for example, whole mount preparations reacted for various antigens have demonstrated an intricate compartmentalization of the cerebellar cortex (White et al., 2012; Cerminara et al., 2015); and reconstructed stacks of consecutive histology slides have successfully demonstrated the complex striosomal architecture (Mikula et al., 2009). The newer techniques, although not without their own problems, offer faster processing, better standardization, and the potential for integration across cellular and subcellular spatial scales.Several volumetric approaches are available. Serial two-photon tomography is a block-face approach developed in the early 2000's and now in routine use for whole mouse brains (Ragan et al, 2012; Kim et al., 2015). The main features (reviewed in Amato et al., 2016) include straightforward specimen preparation, minimal tissue processing, automated and robust data acquisition, and high resolution 3-D reconstructions. In confocal light sheet microscopy ({LSM}), the approach used by Silvestri et al., the sample is illuminated with a thin sheet of light and optically sectioned, typically in a wide-field detection scheme. Millions of pixels are collected simultaneously by a camera instead of sequentially as in standard confocal or two-photon microscopy. Several modifications have been developed, each with some tradeoffs between the physical width of the lightsheet and the size of the specimen that can be imaged. Thin lightsheets (5\${\textbackslash}mathrm{\textbackslash}m u\$m -\${\textless}\$1\${\textbackslash}mathrm{\textbackslash}m u\$m) provide the best axial resolution, but are limited to small samples. Physical specifications and configuration are reviewed in Silvestri et al, as well as in a number of other sources, reflecting the intense interest in this burgeoning field (Reynaud et al., 2015; Richardson and Lichtman, 2015; Santi, 2011; Tomer et al., 2015).{LSM} entails a number of interrelated steps, which are clearly detailed in Silvestri et al. As shown in their figure 1, the experimental pipeline for large-volume quantitative neuroanatomy consists of tissue clearing (for which there are a number of options; see also Richardson and Lichtman, 2015), actual imaging, image stitching, automatic cell localization, and further statistical analysis. None of these steps are routine and all are best viewed as still under development. The Authors are careful to emphasize that what they call large-scale quantitative neuroanatomy is still in its infancy (last paragraph of the Discussion) and requires both aggressive quality control and interactive testing of visualization and annotation tools. A major factor in the new pipeline is (for neuroscientists) the unaccustomedly huge size of the datasets, requiring sophisticated analysis capabilities and a disposition for multi-disciplinary interactions (see Reynaud et al., 2015: “The technology is ready to assist biologists in tackling scientific problems, but are biologists ready for it?”). On the positive side, these exigencies are encouraging the fast emergence of a new mindset, eager to accept the interdisciplinary challenges.Silvestri et al. take as a specific application the number and arrangement of Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum. This is an attractive target for multiple reasons: Purkinje cells are large, unambiguously identifiable by virtue of their size and location, they are moderately well-isolated, and variations have been reported in instances of human pathological conditions. The total number of Purkinje cells calculated in the selected P10 L7-{GFP} mouse is given as 221,107. This accords well with the estimates derived from unbiased stereology (e.g., Woodruff-Pak, 2006). Silvestri et al., report further geometric data, acquired by a clustering algorithm. Setting the number of nearest neighbors equal to 3, the Authors report that 94\% of identified Purkinje cells occur in large clusters, that 1131 clusters are made up of fewer than 100 cells, and that there are 1389 isolated neurons. This analysis is reminiscent of similar spatial analysis of apical dendritic bundles in cerebral cortex. In several studies, tangential sections through cortical layer 3 have revealed an organized array of dendritic clusters, containing about 50 dendrites in humans or 30 in macaque monkeys (Peters, 1994; Gabbott, 2003). This and other quantitative/pattern questions are well-suited to re-investigation with the new, faster protocols.In summary, large-scale quantitative neuroanatomy, via 3-D data acquisition and analysis, has emerged as an important new tool. More than tool, it is spearheading a welcome “user's group”/new community with shared interests and priorities. The energy is palpable, and bodes well for renewed attention to basic neuroanatomical issues. It effectively rebuts, via standardization and quantification, the old accusation of neuroanatomy as “descriptive.” Major challenges undoubtedly lie ahead. Technical: can the current tradeoff of resolution and field width in {LSM} be narrowed? What are the effective ways for dealing with very large datasets? Sociological: how do we optimally combine the traditional small, {PI} driven lab with large centers or core facilities? Databases with ideas? Conceptual: What issues are the most tractable to this approach? How do we achieve more effective methodological integration; for example, gene expression data or receptor distribution along with cytoarchitecture? How do we incorporate cell type and connectivity data? How do we incorporate the temporal domain? Questions notwithstanding, this is an impressive new direction, and continued progress on all fronts can be expected.},

Here we introduce such a kinematic framework, bridging cell and tissue behaviors at an intermediate, mesoscopic, level of cell clusters or domains. By measuring domain deformation in terms of the relative motion of cell positions and the evolution of their shapes, we characterized the basic invariant quantities that measure fundamental classes of cell behavior, namely tensorial rates of cell shape change and cell intercalation. In doing so we introduce an explicit definition of cell intercalation as a continuous process. We mapped strain rates spatiotemporally in three models of tissue morphogenesis, gaining insight into morphogenetic mechanisms. Our quantitative approach has broad relevance for the precise characterization and comparison of morphogenetic phenotypes.},
