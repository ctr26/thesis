Chapter 3 comments.

Mainly I've made specific comments. Overall the story seems correct. I think it is essential to include the coordinate system in the first figure (unless you've already standardised it in an earlier chapter).

Note: the word 'photosite' can be used to refer to 'camera pixel' to distinguish it from a pixel of image data or a screen pixel. If you use it, introduce it as 'photosite (camera pixel)' the first time you use it.

For your chapter 8, I'll try and do Thursday.

Since your chapter 8 has lots of equations, please have a look at slide 6 in my attached presentation on common problems in final drafts (it's for undergrads writing reports, and I've just been preparing it based the feedback I wrote for my IIB reports this year) - which gives a good example of how to introduce algebraic terms in a way that flows with the equation. Hopefully the other slides aren't so useful for you.

Cheers,
Eric
