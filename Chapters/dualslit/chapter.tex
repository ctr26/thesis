\section{Principles}



\subsection{Simulations}
% Use James' simulation to show 2 beads together produces a bad curve
\section{Implementation}

Galvo mirror and virtual Slit
Galvo mirror and static slit with relay optics and de-scanning unit
Galvo mirror and fast actuator

Using virtual slit requires precise synchronisation.
Need an initial delay, as sCMOS chip used here requires a 10ms period to initialise electronics.
During this period the Galvo can be pre-driven so that the velocity is linear once the exposure begins
The galvo is then sinusoidally returned at the end of the exposure.

\subsection{Slit-descanning} %Huisken did this in hyperspectral paper
\subsection{Improvement} %Could use fran's results or repeat mine (rather latter)

\subsection{Limitations} %Show that mismatch between beam and slit xy is bad and z is bad
\section{Double speed slit-scanning microscopy}

The sensor used in the Orca Flash v4 (as well as other sCMOS cameras including the Pco.Edge and Andor Zyla) consists of two adjacent Fairchild sCMOS chips.
In global shutter mode a shutter will propagate outwards from the centre of the chip simultaneously and in the fastest exposure possible for each chip (10ms), this provides the maximum 100 Hz imaging.
For confocal slit scanning the chips are addressed serially with a single thin shutter propagating from one side of the chip to the other.
In this mode the maximum frame rate achievable was 50 Hz when confocally scanning.

In this work a custom camera firmware was used to enable a pair of confocal slits to scan simultaneously providing the \SI{100}{\hertz} that was ordinarily available in global shutter mode.

\subsection{Implementation}
\subsubsection{SLM}
Initially an SLM was imaged directly onto the first scan lens using a pair of imaging relays; the relay at the scan mirror made the image plane of the scan lens accessible whilst the second relay controlled the pixel size of the SLM at the imaging plane of the excitation objective.

\subsubsection{Oversampling}
A solution requiring no additional optics was conceived; by running the galvanometric mirrors at a very high frequency and pulsing the laser appropriately a sampling could be achieved that would appear to be two independent laser sources moving in unison.
The round trip time of the mirror so that this sampling would be achieved would in the best case would have to match the time it takes for the shutter to move up one row of pixels, $\frac{\SI{10}{\milli\second}}{1024}$.
The drive frequency would then exceed \SI{100}{\kilo\hertz}, which is not currently feasible with commercial scanning mirror technology

\subsubsection{Optical approach}
An alternative method was employed whereby immediately after all four colours were aligned spatially, a beam splitter was added with two returning mirrors, similarly to Michelson interferometer
Instead of the two arms of the pseudo-interferometer being interfered, they were purposely aimed off to create a small angle in between them before reaching the scanning mirror.
This slight angular difference, once imaged through the telecentric scan lens, then became a spatial separation at the imaging plane of the system that was easily tuned using the kinematic mirrors around the beam splitter.

The all optical approach offered many advantages: The system was entirely polarisation insenstive and suffered minimal optical losses, especially when compared to using an SLM. As the duplication of the beams was now indepepednet of any beam shaping, actual beam shaping optics could be readily implemented, this had the potential for optics such as cubic phase masks and axicon lenses or even an SLM being inserted to create exotic beams.

\subsection{Results}

A characterisation of the optimal slit width of the virtual slit was needed to provide a maximal contrast.
A volume of \SI{\sim 31} beads was imaged using varying slit widths.
From these 100 beads over 5 volumes a single candidate bead that was not as part of an aggregate, sufficiently bright and unobscured, was found.
By analysing both the SNR and the contrast of each cropped window around the candidate bead it was shown that the ideal slit width was \SI{2.51}{\micro\metre} which is on the order of the width of the incident laser beam.
The SNR was evaluated by computing the ratio of its summed squared magnitude to that of the noise.
The contrast was calculated by fitting a 2D Gaussian to each bead image and plotting the fitted amplitude $A$, from:

\begin{align}
  A e^{-\left(\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}-\frac{(y-y_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}
\end{align}

\section{Simulations and Theory}
\subsection{Light-sheet}

Confocal slit scanning extends the pass band of the objective to up double in one direction.

\subsection{Structured illumination}

\subsubsection{Widefield}

A similar effect to a swept beam in a light-sheet system can be realised in a widefield system.
By conjugating an SLM to the image plane of the objective with suitable polarisers, activate pixels on the SLM will exclusively illuminate the corresponding region in the image plane.
To then mimic a scanning light-sheet as above one can activate a row of SLM pixels and synchronously sweeping that line with a confocal virtual shutter on the camera.
With this the contrast and resolution of the output image will increase in one direction (Figure \ref{fig:}).

The application of confocal slit scanning was also considered for structured illumination sources.
In the case of SIM and mSIM, patterned light is projected onto a sample to provide a resolution doubling after a reconstruction step.
SIM itself relies on frequency mixing to shift high resolution information from outside the pass band of the objective into the observable, reminiscent of a heterodyne.
mSIM uses a square lattice of points scanned snaked across the sample to provide a fast parallelised confocal-like image.
Each spot is virtually pinholed computationally to and the resulting images are summed to produce a final super-resolved image.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{widefield_slit}
  \caption{Simulation of a confocally scanned wide-field system. a) Is the raw, image with b) showing Fourier space and it's frequency passband.

  d) is the final image as it would appear after an acquisition and e) is the the new larger OTF is frequency space.
  }
  \label{fig:widefield_slit}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{SIM}

To reliably reconstruct a SIM image, high contrast fringes are needed to very accurately localise their points in Fourier space as fringe contrast in image space corresponds to the amplitude of the delta functions of a sinusoid in Fourier space..
If the localisation of these points is inaccurate, inverting the process of un-mixing the frequencies computationally will cause artefacts in the final image.
As discussed, slit scanning has the potential to increase image contrast without a sacrifice on speed of acquisition.
To achieve this in SIM requires a very fast ferroelectric SLM.
As in the widefield case, a row of active pixels is swept during an exposure but now this pattern is the product of a standard set of SIM patterns (Figure \ref{fig:sim_slit}).
For these simulations 9 patterns were used, 3 angles and 3 phases; though fewer can be used.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{sim_slit}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:sim_slit}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{mSIM}

For mSIM, During each exposure the SLM will display a single row illumination spots of the full lattice from a standard mSIM pattern.
This row is then swept synchronously with the virtual slit as before.
The act of using a virtual slit on the camera reduces the dimensionality of the reconstruction of an mSIM image, drastically increasing the speed of an acquisition without the need for additional optics.
Schroff at for instance require $200 \times 200$ images for a single mSIM reconstruction.
The proposed method would therefore increase the speed of this process by 200 fold.
This is dwarfed by iSIM, which gives instantaneous super-resolved images at the cost of requiring extensive optics.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{msim_slit}
  \caption{
  a) The capturing of a single mSIM frame;
  b) mSIM illumination pattern as it rolls;
  c) reconstructed slit-mSIM image;
  d) OTF of a single mSIM frame;
  e) OTF of reconstructed slit-mSIM frame
  }
  \label{}
\end{figure}


Reconstructions for SIM were achieved using fairSIM.
fairSIM however assumes that each angle provided will have the same size OTF just rotated.
However, when using slit scanning the OTF support is large; as such fairSIM, though it reconstructs succesfully, omits resolution in the $y$ direction.
For this work a custom reconstruction algorithm will be needed to maximise reconstruction reconstruction.

\subsection{Summary}

The assumptions made here are that the imaging system is ideal, that imaging is only a frequency passband and that the axial is infinity thin.

There exist adapters to split the image on the chip into two colours, could use slit scanning for that, though no room for tuning.
